    <h4>
        An nth root of unity is a complex number \(z\) such that \(z^n\) = 1.
    </h4>
    <h4>
    a) Prove that the nth roots of unity form a cyclic subgroup of \(\mathbb{C}^\times\) of order \(n\).
    </h4>
  
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Proof</b></p>


<p>
    <b>
        Recall that our original \(\lambda\) solutions in \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\) are the roots of unity. 
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    This forms a solution set which we can denote as \(G_n =\{\forall k=0,1,\cdots n-1,\lambda = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\}\). This solution set
    forms a group under multiplication. We can show that that is indeed the case, 
</p>
<p><b>Closure: 
</b></p>
<p>
    We know that the expression \(\lambda = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} = \cos(\frac{2k\pi i}{n}) + \sin(\frac{2k\pi i}{n})i\). 
    We know that whenever we multiply any solution in the set we are effectively rotating the by a given angle this is because 
    \(e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} \cdot e^{\frac{2k'\pi i}{n}} = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n} + \frac{2k'\pi i}{n}}  \). We know that we have 
    \(n\) solutions in our set each are at a given angle \(\frac{2k\pi i}{n}\) where \(k\) is some natural number. Notice that this means 
    our solution set is rotationally symmetric. 
</p>
<p>
    Thus whenever we "add" multiples of the same \(\frac{2\pi i}{n}\) angle we will always get a value that is rotationally symmetric to our solution set.
    This is because  \( e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} = \cos(\frac{2k\pi i}{n}) + \sin(\frac{2k\pi i}{n})i\). This guarantees that 
    whenever we multiply anything within our solution set we will get a value that is equivlanet in our set to the product. Thus guarantees closure. 
</p>
<p><b>Neutral element: 
</b></p>
<p>
    The mutliplicative netural element is \(1\). We know that \(1\) will always be a solution to \(\lambda  = \sqrt[n]{1}\). This is trivial to show 
    why 1 is the mutliplcative netural elements since. Furthermore this shows that this is a none empty set. 
</p>
<p><b>Associativity: 
</b></p>
<p>
    We know that   \(e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} \cdot e^{\frac{2k'\pi i}{n}} = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} \cdot e^{\frac{2k'\pi i}{n}}   \)
    which we know is true from the regular definition of multiplication. 
</p>
<p><b>Inverse: 
</b></p>
<p>
    We know that the mutliplcative inverse exists for some arbitrary element of our set lets call \(e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\) 
    we construct the element \(e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}} - \frac{2k\pi i}{n}  \) We know that this is in our set because 
    \(e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n} - \frac{2\pi i}{n}} = e^{\frac{2\pi i (k-1)}{n} }\) we know the case when \(k=0\) that it itself 
    is the neutral element already. 
</p>
\[e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} \cdot e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n} - \frac{2k\pi i}{n} } = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}{n}  = e^{2\pi}= 1   \]
<p>
    Thus we've proven that this solution set \(G_n\) forms a group. 
</p>
<p><b>Cyclic: 
</b></p>
<p>
    We can prove this is in fact cyclic, if we were to take an some arbitrary element of the group which we've defined as \(\lambda =  e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\)
</p>
<p>
    We know that if we were to repeated multiply this value by it self as such 
    \(e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\cdot e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\cdots e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}} = (e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}})^{n+1} \)
</p>
<p>
    We'd get the following: \( (e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}})^{n+1} = (e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}})^n (e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}) =e^{2k\pi i} (e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}})  \)
    We've already shown that this is the multiplicative neutral element thus we get. \( (e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}})^{n+1} = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\). Thus we've shown that 
    with sufficent number of multiplications we arrive at the identity map. Thus we've shown its cyclic. 
</p>
<h4>
    b) Determine the product of all the nth roots of unity.

</h4>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
    All the roots of unity can be generated in the following set as such:
</p>
\[G_n =\{\forall k=0,1,\cdots n-1| \lambda = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\}\]
<p>
    Thus each element say the \(k\)th element of \(G_n\) is really just \(e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\). Lets index each of these elements as such: 
</p>
\[g_k\in G_n: g_k = e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{n}}\]
<p>
    We can explicitly express the product \(P\) of each of these as the following: 
</p>
\[P = g_0\cdot g_1 \cdot g_2 \cdots g_{n-1}\]
\[P = e^{0}\cdot e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}} \cdot e^{\frac{4\pi i}{n}}  \cdots e^{\frac{2(n-1)\pi i}{n}} \]
\[P = e^{\frac{2(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k)\pi i}{n}} \]
\[P = e^{(n-1)\pi i} \]
\[P = (e^{\pi i})^{(n-1)} \]
\[P = (-1)^{(n-1)} \]

    <p>We previously eluded to the Schrodinger equation without actually solving 
        what this equation is given a particular problem. What is this wave? How do we get \(\Psi(x,t)\) to begin with?
    </p>
      \[i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2}+ V\Psi\]

    <p>We assume that the potential given \(V(x,t)\) is independent of time \(t\) so how do we get back our \(\Psi\)? We use seperation of variables technique 
        to tackle this partial differential equation. We assume the following. 
    </p>
    \[\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)\phi(t)\]
    <p>Now if we took the partial derivative in respect to \(x\) and then the partial derivative in respect to \(t\). Notice that since we seperated the variables 
        one is left constant the other is inside the derivative. 
    </p>
    \[\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)\frac{\partial \phi(t)}{\partial t}\]
    \[\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\Psi(x,t) = \phi(t)\frac{\partial \psi(x) }{\partial x}\]
    <p>We can say the same about the second order derivative. </p>
    \[\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2}\Psi(x,t) = \psi(x)\frac{\partial^2 \phi(t)}{\partial t^2}\]
    \[\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x^2}\Psi(x,t) = \phi(t)\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x) }{\partial x^2}\]
    <p>Now we replace the original equation. </p>
    \[i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2}+ V\Psi\]
    \[i\hbar  \psi(x)\frac{\partial \phi(t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\phi(t)\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x) }{\partial x^2}+ V \psi(x)\phi(t)\]
    <p>We can divide through by \( \psi(x)\phi(t)\)</p>
    \[i\hbar  \frac{1}{\phi}\frac{\partial \phi(t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{1}{\psi}\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x) }{\partial x^2}+ V \]
    <p><b>KEY:</b> The left and the right side vary by different variables. The only possibility for this equation to be equal is if these values are CONSTANTS. </p>
    <p>Lets set them equal to a constant then. </p>
    \[i\hbar  \frac{1}{\phi}\frac{\partial \phi(t)}{\partial t} = E \]
    <p>We can simplify these by multiplying by \(\phi\) getting rid of the fraction. </p>
    \[i\hbar  \frac{\partial \phi(t)}{\partial t} = \phi E \]
    <p>On the other side we have this equation. </p>
    \[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{1}{\psi}\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x) }{\partial x^2}+ V  = E \]
    <p>We can simplify these by multiplying by \(\psi\) getting rid of the fraction. </p>
    \[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \psi(x) }{\partial x^2}+ V\psi  = \psi E \]
    <p>We've seperated the variables and turned the partial differential equations to just ordinary differential equations. The first equation is easy to solve. </p>
    \[i\hbar  \frac{d \phi(t)}{d t} = \phi E \]
    \[i\hbar \frac{1}{ \phi E }  d\phi=dt \]
    <p>Integrate both sides</p>
    \[ \frac{i\hbar }{E}\int \frac{1}{ \phi  }  d\phi= \int dt \]
    \[ \frac{i\hbar }{E} \ln \phi +C = t + C\]
    \[ \ln \phi  = \frac{E }{i\hbar} (t + C)\]
    \[ \phi(t)  = e^{\frac{E }{i\hbar} (t + C)}\]
    \[\phi(t)= e^{-i \frac{Et}{\hbar}} \]
    <P>You can learn more about solving these kind of equations  <a href="https://petchma.github.io/Solutions/multivar_calc/diff_eq1.html">here</a></P>
    <p>Now this is what we get. </p>
    \[\Psi(x,t) =\psi(x)e^{-i \frac{Et}{\hbar}}\]
    <p>Question now is how do we solve for \(\psi\)? <b>\(\psi\) is called the time independent Schordinger equation. </b></p>
    <h2>Stationary States and Hamiltonian </h2>
    <h3>
        Stationary States
    </h3>
    <p>Notice that when we take the square of the wave function \(|\Psi(x,t)|^2\) the time component vanishes as you take the product of its complex conjugate. </p>
    \[|\Psi(x,t)|^2 = \Psi^*\Psi = \psi(x)e^{-i \frac{Et}{\hbar}} \psi(x)e^{i \frac{Et}{\hbar}} = |\psi(x)|^2 \]
    <p>The time dependence cancels in fact every expectation value is constant in time. </p>
    <h3>
        Hamiltonian
    </h3>
    <p>The hamiltonian is the total energy in a given state. In classical mechanics its the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. We can write the Hamiltonian as ...</p>
    \[H(x,v) = \frac{mv^2}{2}+V(x)\]
    \[H(x,v) = \frac{m^2v^2}{2m}+V(x)\]
    \[H(x,p) = \frac{p^2}{2m}+V(x)\]
    <p>We know that the momentum operator is \(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\)</p>
    \[H(x,p) = \frac{(i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x})^2}{2m}+V(x)\]
    \[H(x,p) = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\]
    <p>This is called the Hamiltonian Operator. Notice that his is almost EXACTLY the time independent Schrodinger equation. </p>
    <p>Thus the time independent Schrodinger equation is the Hamiltonian operator on the time independent Schrodinger equation. </p>
    \[\hat{H} \psi = E \psi\]
    <h2>
        Infinite Solutions
    </h2>
    <p>I turns out that the time independent Schrodinger equation has an infinite amount of solutions, that depend on the initial conditions of the problem. 
        The general solution is linear combination of seperable solutions. This is because the constant \(E\) has no restrictions so all you need to do is find the right constants.
    </p>
    \[\Psi(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n \psi_n(x,t)e^{-iE_n t / \hbar}\]
    <p>To solve for these constants which solves the time independent Schrodinger equation, it would be problem specific. We'll explore these.</p>

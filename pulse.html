    <p>Pulsars are very dense stars that circulate and spin around with periods of 1.4 ms and 8.5 seconds. 
        Despite their name being "pusles", their radio emission is actually continuous but beamed, so any one observer sees a pulse of 
        radiation each time the beam sweeps across his line-of-sight.
    </p>
    <p>The existence of these neutron stars are due to the end of their stellar evolution. Pulsars are a type of neutron stars
        that is greater than 1.4 solar masses. These stars are important to our understanding of physics as they are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are a physics playground for the extreme conditions in the universe. </li>
        <li>They are really stable and also act as very accurate clocks. Their periods can have an accuracy of \(10^{-16}\) percision. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The basic approach for the existence of pulsars are that their spin needs to generate a centrafugal force thats is less 
        than the graviational field or else it will blow apart! Let \(\Omega = 2\pi /P\) where P is the PERIOD and the gravational field describes the acceleration of the object 

    </p>
    \[\Omega^2 R = a\]
    \[\Omega^2 R < {G M \over R^2}\]
    \[Omega = {2\pi f  }\]
    \[Omega = {2\pi \over P }\]
    \[{4 \pi^2 R^3 \over P^2} < GM\]
    <p>Now we are going to preform a TRICK to rearrange the equation to fit the VOLUME of the equation</p>
    \[P^2 > \biggl( { 4 \pi R^3 \over
        3} \biggr) {3 \pi \over G M}\]
    <p>Note everything is still equal to the original equation. We just switched it around and now it contains the inverse volume of a sphere!</p>
        <p>If we define \(\rho\) as the average DENSITY </p>
        \[\rho = m/V\]
        \[\rho =
        M \biggl( { 4 \pi R^3 \over
        3} \biggr)^{-1}\]
        <p>We notice we can replace part of the equation with INVERSE Density!!!</p>
        \[P > \biggl( { 3 \pi \over G \rho}
        \biggr)^{1/2}\]
        \[{\rho
            > { 3 \pi \over G P^2}}\]
    <p>This is actually a very conservative lower limit to  because a rapidly spinning star becomes oblate, 
        increasing the centrifugal acceleration and decreasing the gravitational acceleration at its equator.</p>
    <p>Now if we were to discuss the energy and the magnetic dipole interactions. We can use larmor's radiation
        formula once again.
    </p>
    \[P_{\rm rad} = { 2 q^2 \dot{v}^2
    \over 3 c^3} = {2 \over 3} { (q
    \ddot{r} \sin \alpha)^2 \over c^3} = {2 \over 3} { ( \ddot{p}_\bot )^2
    \over c^3}\]
    <p>The reason we use \(\ddot{r} \sin \alpha\) because the acceleration we're looking for is perpendicular 
        to the radius change between the dipoles. Thus we take the \(\sin \alpha \). And double dots over the radius 
        gives us the acceleration. 
    </p>
    <p>Also \( \ddot{p}\) represents the magnetic moment. Which is \(m = qr\)</p>
    <p>For a uniformly magnetized sphere with radius R and surface magnetic field strength B, the magnetic dipole moment is</p>
    \[m = B R^3\]
    <p>Now if we want to represent this ocilating magnetic moment as we spin we have this </p>
    \[m =
    m_0 \exp ( - i \Omega t)\]
    <p>Then we try and calculate the second derivative of the moment in respect to time we get </p>
    \[\dot{m} = - i \Omega m_0 \exp ( - i
    \Omega t)\]
    \[\ddot{m} = \Omega^2 m_0 \exp ( -i \Omega t)\]
    <p>NOTICE THAT THE THING ON THE INSIDE IS THE ORIGINAL magnetic moment. </p>
    \[\ddot{m} =  \Omega^2
    m\]
    <p>Plug it back in we get </p>
    \[P_{\rm rad} = {2 \over 3} { m_\bot^2 \Omega^4 \over c^3} = {2
        m_\bot^2 \over 3 c^3} \biggl( {2 \pi \over P} \biggr)^4 = {2 \over 3
        c^3} ( B R^3 \sin \alpha)^2 \biggl( {2 \pi \over P} \biggr)^4\]
    <p>If we want to find the rotational kinetic energy we have the following: </p>
    \[E_{\rm rot} = \frac{1}{2}I \Omega^2 = {2 \pi^2 I
        \over P^2}\]
    <p>We know that pulsars slow down gradually. P is the value for period.  </p>
    \[\dot{P} \equiv {d P
        \over d t} > 0\]
    \[{d E_{\rm rot} \over d t} = {d \over d t} \left( \frac{1}{2} I
    \Omega^2 \right) = I \Omega \dot{\Omega}\]
    \[\Omega = {2 \pi \over P} \qquad {\rm so} \qquad \dot{\Omega} = 2 \pi
    (-P^{-2} \dot{P})\]
    \[{d E_{\rm rot} \over d t} = I \Omega
    \dot{\Omega} = I {2 \pi \over P} { 2 \pi ( - \dot{P}) \over P^2 }\]
    \[{{d E_{\rm rot} \over d t}  =
    {-4
    \pi^2 I \dot{P} \over P^3}}\]
    <p>We know that </p>
    \[P_{\rm rad} = - {d E_{\rm rot} \over
    d t}\]
    \[{2 \over 3 c^3} (B R^3 \sin
    \alpha)^2 \biggl( { 4 \pi^2 \over P^2}
    \biggr)^2 = {4 \pi^2 I \dot{P} \over P^3}\]
    \[B^2 = { 3 c^3 I P \dot{P} \over 2
    \cdot 4 \pi^2 R^6 \sin^2\alpha
    }\]
    \[B > \biggl( { 3 c^3 I \over 8
        \pi^2 R^6} \biggr)^{1/2} (P
        \dot{P})^{1/2}\]
    <p>Therefore we can solve for the minimum magnetic field strength at the pulsar surface.</p>
    <p>One last trick is we can calculat the life time of the pulsar by looking at the decay. </p>
    \[\B^2 = { 3 c^3 I P \dot{P} \over 8 \pi^2 R^6 \sin^2
    \alpha}]
    <p>we can find that</p>
    \[P \dot{P} = {8 \pi^2 R^6 (B \sin \alpha)^2
        \over 3 c^3 I }\]
    <p>We also know that </p>
    \[
     dP = \dot{P} d t\]
     <p>Multiply both sides </p>
     \[P dP = P \dot{P} d t\]
     <p>We can integrate through the entire life time </p>
     \[\int_{P_0}^P P d P = \int_0^\tau
     (P \dot{P})\, d t \]
     \[\int_{P_0}^P P d P = P \dot{P} \int_0^\tau d t \]
     <p>We can then solve </p>
     \[{P^2 - P_0^2 \over 2} = P \dot{P}
     \tau\]
     <p>If the pulse period is alot bigger than the inital pulse period than we can approx with the following</p>
     \[{\tau \equiv { P \over 2
        \dot{P}}}\]

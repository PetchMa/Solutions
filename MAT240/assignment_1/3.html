<h4>
    Let \(f:X→Y\) be a map. The map \(g:Y→X\) is called an inverse of \(f\) when it satisfies the properties
    \[g \circ f = I_x \quad and \quad f \circ g = I_y \]
    where \(I_z\) means the identity map from \(z\) to itself.
</h4>
<h3>
    a) Prove that if an inverse of the map \(f\) exists, then it is unique.
</h3>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Proof</b></p>
<p>Let \(k\) be an inverse of \(f\) such that \(k \circ f  = I_x\)</p>
\[g =  I_x \circ g \]
\[g = (k \circ f) \circ g \]
\[g = k \circ (f \circ g )\]
\[g = k \circ  I_y\]
\[g = k \]
<P>Thus we've proven that the inverse of \(f\) is unique, since there does not exist \(k\) such that it doesn't equal \(g\) meaning the inverse is unique.</P>
<h3>
    b) Give an example of a non-invertible map \(f\).
</h3>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Example: \(f: X\rightarrow Y, f(x) = x^2 \)</p>
<!-- <p>This function is non invertable since the domain of the inverse cannot </p> -->
<h3>
    c) Prove that \(f\) is invertible (i.e. it has an inverse) if and only if it is a bijection.
</h3>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Proof By Contradiction.</b></p>
<p>Assume that \(f\) is not bijective and has an inverse.</p>
<p>If \(f\) isn't bijective that would imply that either.... </p>
<ol>
    <li>
        \(f\) is injective. 
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>
        \(f\) is surjective.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        \(f\) is neither.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><b>If \(f\) is injective</b> it cannot guarantee that all values of the inverse's domain can be mapped to \(I_x\). 
Meaning that  the condition of \(f \circ g(I_y) = I_y \) will be contradicted. </p>


<p><b>If \(f\) is surjective</b> that would imply that there could \(\exists x_1,x_2\in X: x_1\neq x_2\) and \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\) 
    that would imply that \(g\circ f (x_1)\) could equal \(x_1\) or \(x_2\). That contradicts the definition of a mapping
    where the element of a domain, cannot be mapped to two different images. 
</p>
<p><b>If \(f\) is neither</b> then its neither injective nor surjective. This implies there exist multiple elements
    of the domain which maps to the same image, AND not all elements of the codomain is mapped by \(f\). The fact that not all elements of the 
    codomain of \(f\) has a map already contradicts the condition of \(f \circ g(I_y) = I_y \). Thus \(f\) wouldn't be invertable.
</p>
<p><b>If \(f\) is bijective</b> then by definition, \(\forall x_1,x_2 \in X: x_1\neq x_2, f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)\) AND 
    \(\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X :f(x)=y\). 
    This would mean that \(g \circ f = I_x\) since every \(y\in Y\) is mapped only once to an \(x \in X\). 
    \(f \circ g = I_y\) would also be guaranteed since by definition of bijection every value \(y\in Y\) is mapped by \(f\) from \(x \in X\)
    thus \(f \circ g = I_y\).
</p>
<p>By contradiction we've shown that \(f\) is invertible if and only if it is a bijection. </p>
<h3>
    d) Suppose \(f:X→Y\) and \(g:Y→X\) are such that \(g∘f=I_x\). Does it follow that \(f∘g=I_y\)? Why?
</h3>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
    No. This is because the condition \(g∘f=I_x\) doesn't guarantee that every value given by \(g\) can be mapped in the function \(f\).
     There <u>can</u> still exist a value that \(g\) returns that does not get mapped back by \(f\).
</p>

<h3>
    e) Let \(f,g\) be as in part d), with the additional assumption that \(f\) is surjective. Does it follow that \(f∘g=I_y\)? Why?
</h3>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Solution</b></p>
<p>
Yes we can.  Firstly, since \(f\) is surjective, by definition every element of \(Y\) has <u>at least one map from set \(X\)</u>.
But since we know that \(g∘f=I_x\) it would mean every map <u>\(f\) has one map</u>, or else, there could \(\exists x_1,x_2\in X: x_1\neq x_2\) and \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\) 
that would imply that \(g\circ f (x_1)\) could equal \(x_1\) or \(x_2\). That contradicts the definition of a mapping.

   <p>The tripy thing about spherical coordinates is that the gradient calculations are a bit different. For example laplace's equation in spherical coordinates looks like this.
   </p>
   \[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial V}{\partial r})+\frac{1}{r^2\sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\sin\theta \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta}) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin \theta}  \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi} =0 \]
   <p>
       However since there is azimuthal symmetry, the \(\phi\) component is independent of V and we can just disregard it. 
   </p>
   \[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial V}{\partial r})+\frac{1}{r^2\sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\sin\theta \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta}) =0 \]

   <p>In order to preform speration of variables we do this thing where we assume the variables are seperate and try to get back the original potential. </p>
   \[V(r,\theta) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)\]
   <p>We divide the entire thing by V</p>
   \[\frac{1}{R}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial R}{\partial r})+\frac{1}{\Theta\sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\sin\theta \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \theta}) =0 \]
   <p>We see that the roots to the differential equation are linear thus our seperation must be constant.</p>
   \[\frac{1}{R}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial R}{\partial r}) = l(l+1) \]
   \[\frac{1}{\Theta\sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\sin\theta \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \theta})  = -l(l+1) \]
   <p>The way we wrote the seperation constant is just some fancy trick. </p>
   \[\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial R}{\partial r}) = Rl(l+1) \]
   <p>This has a general solution in this form....</p>
   \[R(r) = Ar^l + \frac{B}{r^{l+1}}\]
   <p>However with the angular equation things a different....</p>
   \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(\sin\theta \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \theta})  = -l(l+1)\sin (\theta)  \Theta \]
   <p>We have to use something called Legendre Polynomials in the variable \(\cos\theta\) where its determined by Rodrigues formula</p>
   \[\Theta(\theta) = P_1(\cos\theta)\]
   \[P_1(x) = \frac{1}{2^ll!}(\frac{d}{dx})^l(x^2-1)^l\]
   <p>If we were to combined the seperated variables we get the following: </p>
   \[V(r,\theta) = (Ar^l + \frac{B}{r^{l+1}})P_1(\cos\theta)\]
   \[V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0} ^{\infty}( Ar^l + \frac{B}{r^{l+1}})P_1(\cos\theta)\]
   <h3>Problem: The intial potential is specified for surface of a hollow sphere of radius R. Find the potential inside the sphere.</h3>
   \[V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0} ^{\infty}( Ar^l + \frac{B}{r^{l+1}})P_1(\cos\theta)\]
   <p>We know that at R the potential must be the inital \(V_0(\theta)\) stated in the question.</p>
   \[V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0} ^{\infty}( AR^l + \frac{B}{R^{l+1}})P_1(\cos\theta)\]
   <p>B must be zero because at the origin the B term will exploded to \(\infty\). If the problem were about a sphere on the outside the A term would have to equal to zero since the potential approaches 0 at \(\infty\) instead</p>
   \[V(r,\theta) = \sum_{l=0} ^{\infty}( AR^l)P_1(\cos\theta)\]
   <p>Since these legendre Polynomials are orthogonal functions we can do the fourier trick like with the sines. </p>
   \[V(0,\theta) =\sum_{l=0} ^{\infty}P_1(\cos\theta) \]
   \[\int_{-1}^{1}P_l(x)P_{l`}(x) = \int_0^\pi P_l(\cos\theta)P_{l`}(\cos\theta)\sin\theta d\theta\]
   <P>If you were to compute the integral you would get 0's for every value except where \(l = l`\)</P>
   \[A_{l`}R^{l`}\frac{2}{2l`+1} = \int_0^\pi V_0(\theta)P_{l`}(\cos\theta)\sin\theta d\theta\]
   \[A_{l`} = \frac{2l`+1}{2R^{l`}}\int_0^\pi V_0(\theta)P_{l`}(\cos\theta)\sin\theta d\theta\]
   <p>This gives us the general solution to the differential equation since the coefficents are calculated by this integral. </p>

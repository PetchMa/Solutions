       The name of the game here is to find the potential of an arrangement of charges. The thing to note is that, at LARGE distances, any charge distribution
       will have a potential that appears as if they were a single point charge. Okay so how do we find the potential of say, 2 opposite charges? Also called a dipole.
   </p>

<h2>Dipole Example</h2>
   <p>
      A physical dipole of two equal but opposite charges are seperated by a distance d approximate the potential at a far distance.  
   </p>
   \[ V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} (\frac{q}{\eta_+} - \frac{q}{\eta_-})\]
   <p>
       Since \(\eta_\pm\) is the distance from each charge to the a test point (replacing the \(r_p\) and the \(r_m\) in the diagram), and we know that \(r\) would be the distance between the center of the two charges 
       to the test charge we can write the following using COSINE law. \(d\) is the distance between the charges. 
      
   </p>
   \[\eta_\pm^2 = r^2+(\frac{d}{2})^2 \mp rd\cos\theta\]
   <p>We can simplify ye?</p>
   \[\eta_\pm^2 = r^2[1+(\frac{d^2}{4r^2}) \mp \frac{d}{r}\cos\theta]\]
   <p>Note here: as we are approaching \(r >> d\) the term \(\frac{d^2}{4r^2}\) approaches 0 and so we can forget about it in the equation.</p>
   \[\eta_\pm^2 \approx r^2[1 \mp \frac{d}{r}\cos\theta]\]
   \[\eta_\pm \approx r[1 \mp \frac{d}{r}\cos\theta]^{\frac{1}{2}}\]
   \[\frac{1}{\eta_\pm } \approx \frac{1}{r}[1 \mp \frac{d}{r}\cos\theta]^{\frac{-1}{2}}\]
   <p>Okay now we try and factor the term \(1 \mp \frac{d}{r}\cos\theta\) as a perfect square.  </p>
   \[(1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta)^2 =1 \mp \frac{d}{r}\cos\theta + \frac{d^2}{4r^2}\cos^2 \theta  \]
   <p>Like before we know the \(r^2\) term will approach 0 at large distances. And so that matches then with our original binomial and thus we factored it! Kinda.. </p>
   \[\frac{1}{\eta_\pm } \approx \frac{1}{r}(1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta)^{-1}\]
   \[\frac{1}{1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta} =\frac{1}{1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta} \cdot \frac{1 \pm \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta}{1 \pm \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta}\]
   <p>We get a difference of squares</p>
   \[\frac{1}{1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta} =\frac{1 \pm \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta}{1 \pm \frac{d^2}{4r^2}\cos^2\theta} \]
   <p>We know that as \(r>>d\) we can see that the term \(\frac{d^2}{4r^2}\cos^2\theta\) approaches 0</p>
   \[\frac{1}{1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta} =\frac{1 \pm \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta}{1 \pm 0} \]
   \[\frac{1}{1 \mp \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta} =1 \pm \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta \]
   \[\frac{1}{\eta_\pm } \approx \frac{1}{r}[1 \pm \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta]\]
   <p>And so if we were to plug this in from our original potential function. </p>
   \[ V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} (\frac{q}{\eta_+} - \frac{q}{\eta_-})\]
   \[  \frac{1}{\eta_+} - \frac{1}{\eta_-} \approx \frac{1}{r}[1 + \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta] -  \frac{1}{r}[1 - \frac{d}{2r}\cos\theta] \]
   \[  \frac{1}{\eta_+} - \frac{1}{\eta_-} \approx \frac{d}{r^2}\cos\theta\]
   <p>Thus finally our potential looks like this! </p>
   \[ V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} (\frac{dq}{r^2}\cos\theta)\]
   <p>Notice this is exactly how we'd expect the potential to fall off by the sqaure. </p>
   <p>Also notice if we took a dipole and made it into a <b>Quadropole</b> then we'd have the potential falling off at \(\frac{1}{r^3}\). 
    Now if it were an octopole we'd see the potential fall off at \(\frac{1}{r^4}\) and so one might try and generalize this to multipoles.
</p>
   <h2>
       Extending to Multipoles 
   </h2>
   <p>What if we want to build a general case for multiple poles in such that we have a distribution of charges? How might we find the potential of such 
       multipole system?
   </p>
   <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="multipole.jpg" >
</div>
   <p>
       Okay so we have this as the potential right? With a charge distribution of \(\rho(r)\)
   </p>
   \[ V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \int \frac{1}{\eta}\rho(r')d\tau'\]
   <p>Well we can find the value for \(\eta\) with out cosine law. Where \(\eta\) is the distance from the charge to the observer.</p>
   \[\eta^2 = r^2+ r'^2 -2rr'\cos\theta\]
   <p>Do some factoring</p>
   \[\eta^2 = r^2(1 + \frac{r'^2}{r^2} -2\frac{r'}{r}\cos\theta)\]
   <p>We can do some more factoring.</p>
   \[\eta^2 = r^2(1 + (\frac{r'}{r})(\frac{r'}{r} -2\cos\theta))\]
   <p>Let \(\epsilon =(\frac{r'}{r})(\frac{r'}{r} -2\cos\theta) \)</p>
   \[\eta^2 = r^2(1 + \epsilon)\]
   \[\eta = r\sqrt{1 + \epsilon}\]
   \[\frac{1}{\eta}= \frac{1}{r\sqrt{1 + \epsilon}}\]
   <p>Now that the geometry is out of the way. We can do an expansion on the \(\sqrt{1 + \epsilon}\) since its just a binomial. </p>
   \[\frac{1}{\eta}= \frac{1}{r} (1-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon + \frac{3}{8}\epsilon^2 - \frac{5}{16}\epsilon^3+...)\]
   <p>Okay so what if we just sub back in values for epsilon?</p>
   \[\frac{1}{\eta}= \frac{1}{r} (1-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{r'}{r})(\frac{r'}{r} -2\cos\theta) + \frac{3}{8}(\frac{r'}{r})^2(\frac{r'}{r} -2\cos\theta)^2 - \frac{5}{16}(\frac{r'}{r})^3(\frac{r'}{r} -2\cos\theta)^3+...)\]
   <p>Okay then we're gonna collect together like powers of \(\frac{r'}{r}\) and see what happens..</p>
   \[= \frac{1}{r} (1+\frac{r'}{r}\cos{\theta}) +(\frac{r'}{r})^2 \frac{3\cos^3\theta -1}{2}) +(\frac{r'}{r})^3 \frac{5\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta}{2}))\]
   <p>Notice that these are actually Legendre polynomials. So we can collapse it down to this...</p>
   \[\frac{1}{\eta} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{n=0}^\infty (\frac{r'}{r'})^2 P_n(\cos\theta)\]
   <p>So if we were to plug this back into computing the potential. </p>
   \[ V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \int \frac{1}{r} \sum_{n=0}^\infty (\frac{r'}{r'})^2 P_n(\cos\theta)\rho(r')d\tau'\]
   <p>We can move the summation outside ... </p>
   \[ V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}  \sum_{n=0}^\infty\int \frac{1}{r} (\frac{r'}{r'})^2 P_n(\cos\theta)\rho(r')d\tau'\]
   <p>This is the true mathematical depiction for the multipole expansion.</p>
   <h2>Making Life Easier</h2>
   <p>Finding the multipole expansion looks rather daunting from the equation we've produced. However we need to realize is that this sum
       is the sum of a monopole, a dipole, a quadropole, octopole and on and on. But as we discussed previously, the last few terms fall of by \(r^n\) 
       and thus contribute very little to the overall potential. Thus we can simply compute the first few terms instead. Potential is dominated by the monopole term 
       followed by the dipole term etc... 
   </p>
   <p>Okay now lets say you have zero net charge and there is some dipole movement going on. So we can get the dipole term from the multipole expansion...</p>
   \[V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{r^2} \int r' \cos\theta \rho(r') d\tau'\]
   <p>We can rewrite the cosine term with the dot product instead</p>
   \[V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r} \cdot \int r'\rho(r') d\tau'\]
   <p>And so now we have a <b>dipole moment.</b> The dipole moment of the actual distribution is given by </p>
   \[\int r'\rho(r') d\tau'\]

   <h2>Electric field of a Multipole</h2>
   <p>This is really easy. We know that electric field is the negative gradient of the potential we can just compute the following</p>
   \[\vec{E} = - \nabla V_{dip}(r,\theta)\]
   <p>And so you can compute the electric field by computing the potential first. </p>

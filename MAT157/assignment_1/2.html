<h4>
   a) Prove that \(\sqrt{273}\) is irrational.
</h4>
<p style="color: blue;"><b>Proof By Contradiction</b></p>
<p>Assume \(\sqrt{273}\) is rational which implies that we can write it as \(\sqrt{273} = \frac{p}{q}: p,q \in \mathbb{Z}\)</p>
\[\sqrt{273} = \frac{p}{q}\]
\[q\sqrt{273} = p\]
\[273\cdot q^2 = p^2\]
<p>We know that \(p,q\) can be uniquely prime factorized. We know that \(273\) can be prime factorized into \(3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13\)</p>
<p>We can write \(p^2\) as the prime factor of \(p\) except each factor appears twice. This implies that it MUST have an even number of factors. </p>
<p>We can write \(q^2\) as the prime factor of \(q\) except each factor appears twice. This implies that it MUST have an even number of factors. </p>
<p><b>Contradiction.</b> \(p^2\) has an even number of prime factors, however \(q^2 \cdot (3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13)\) clearly has an odd 
number of factors. The equality is false, thus we cannot write \sqrt{273} in the form \(\frac{p}{q}, \quad p,q \in \mathbb{Z}\), this contradicts the premise that \(\sqrt{273}\) is rational. Thus it must be irrational. </p>

<h4>
    b) Prove that \(\sqrt[3]{11}\) is irrational.
 </h4>
 <p style="color: blue;"><b>Proof By Contradiction</b></p>
 <p>Assume \(\sqrt[3]{11}\) is rational which implies that we can write it as \(\sqrt[3]{11} = \frac{p}{q}: p,q \in \mathbb{Z}\) also 
     there are no common factors between \(p,q\). [Relatively prime].
 </p>
 \[\sqrt[3]{11} = \frac{p}{q}\]
 \[q\sqrt[3]{11} = p\]
 \[11\cdot q^3 = p^3\]
 <p>This implies that \(11\) is a factor of \(p^3\), and thus a factor of \(p\) since its the cube of \(p\). 
     We can write it as such then \(p = 11n : n\in \mathbb{Z}\). Lets replace it for \(p\) </p>
\[q\sqrt[3]{11} = 11n\]
\[11\cdot q^3 = 11^3p^3\]
\[ q^3 = 11^2p^3\]
<p>This would imply that \(11\) is ALSO a factor of \(q\). <b>This contradicts the premise that \(p,q\) are relatively prime.</b> 
    Thus we can not write \(\sqrt[3]{11}\) as a rational number. Thus it must be irrational.
</p>
<h4>
    c) Prove that \(\sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{3}\) is rational.
</h4>
<p>We can replace a few of the square roots with trig values. Like such. </p>
\[=\sqrt{4 + 4\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})} - 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})\]
<p>Factor. </p>
\[= 2\sqrt{1 + 1\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})} - 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})\]
<p>We can rewrite the square root into the form of a half angle formula.</p>
\[=2\sqrt{\frac{1 + 1\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})}{2}\cdot 2} - 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})\]
<p>Replace with half angle.</p>
\[=2\sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{12})- 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})\]
<p>We also want to write it such that the angles are the same and thus we can replace with the double angle formula.</p>
\[=2\sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{12})- 2(2\cos^2(\frac{\pi}{12})-1)\]
<p>We can compute the trig values by decomposing the angles as such... </p>
\[=2\sqrt{2}\cos(\frac{4\pi}{12}-\frac{3\pi}{12})- 2(2\cos^2(\frac{4\pi}{12} - \frac{3\pi}{12})-1)\]
<p>Simplifies to the following...</p>
\[=2\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4} - 4(\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4})^2+2\]
\[=\frac{2\sqrt{12}+4}{4} - 4(\frac{6+2\sqrt{12}+2}{16})+2\]
\[=\frac{2\sqrt{12}+4}{4} - (\frac{6+2\sqrt{12}+2}{4})+2\]
\[=\frac{4}{4} - (\frac{8}{4})+2\]
\[=1\]

<p>
    The class is introduced by connecting the ideas in Analysis and generalizing them with these arbitrary sets in a very broad 
    topic of point set topology. 
</p>
<p>
    Lets say we're given som arbitrary space which is a collection of "stuff" and this is what we call a 
    <b> set </b> which is 
    described as: <b>\(X\)</b>. With this space <b>\(X\)</b> we wish to add addition structure, this structure is called a 
    <b>Metric </b> which we define as <b>\(d(x,y)\)</b> where <b>\(x,y\in X\)</b>. You can think of this as some general idea of a <b>Distance</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Metric Definition:</b>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Function is definite: \(d(y,x) = 0 \) <b>if and only if</b> \(x=y\)
    </li>
    <li>
        Function commutes: \(d(y,x) = d(y,x) \) 
    </li>
    <li>
        Obeys triangle inequality commutes: \(d(y,x) \leq d(x,z)+ d(z,y) \) 
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Example of Metrics
</h3>
<p>
    Standard Euclidean Metric:
</p>
\[d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_n-y_n)^2}\]
<p>
    Discrete Metric
</p>
\[d(x,y) =\begin{cases} 
0, & x=y \\
1, & x\neq y
\end{cases}\]
<p>
    We also have the space of continous functions between \((a,b)\) which is defined as:
 </p>
\[d(f,g) = \sqrt{\int_a^b (f(x)-g(x))^2 dx}\]

<h3>
    Note On Spaces 
</h3>
<p>
    There are various other canonical spaces one of them being the hilbert space or \(\ell^p\) space. These are defined as the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><b>
            \(\ell^1\) space
        </b>
        These are the space of all sequences who's series is absolutely convergent. Defined with the following metric:
    </p>
    \[||x|| := \sum^\infty |x_n| \leq \infty\]
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>
            \(\ell^2\) space
        </b>
        the space of square-summable sequences, which is a Hilbert space
    </p>
    \[||y||_2 := \sqrt{\sum^\infty y_n^2} \leq \infty\]
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>
            \(\ell^p\) space
        </b>
        the space of square-summable sequences, which is a Hilbert space
    </p>
    \[||y||_p := \sqrt[p]{\sum^\infty y_n^p} \leq \infty\]
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>
            \(\ell^\infty\) space
        </b>
        the space of bounded sequences.
    </p>
    \[||z||_\infty := \text{sup}_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} |z_n| \leq \infty\]
    </li>
  
</ol>

<h3>
    Continuity 
</h3>
<p>
We can devise a means of defining a limit in these for functions between metric spaces using the definition of the metric. This follows exactly 
from Analysis of \(\epsilon-\delta\) definitions except we use a metric:
</p>
\[\forall \epsilon > 0  \exists \delta >0 : d(x,y)< \delta  \Rightarrow d(f(x),y(x)) < \epsilon \quad \text{for }\mathbb{R}^n \]
<h3>
    Open Balls
</h3>
<p>
    Imagine a point in some arbitrary space, since we defined the notion of a distance we can then "sweep" around some abstract 
    shape of a sphere which can be called <b>\(B_a(r)\)</b> where \(a\in X\) and \(r\) is some radius. We get: 
</p>
\[B_a(r) := \{\forall x \in X | d(x,a) < r\}\]

<h3>
    Continuity - In Terms of Open Balls
</h3>
<p>
   The idea is that the mapping of an entire ball to the image and then taking the preimage, if that preimage of that map of the ball is a subset 
   of the original ball, then the map is continous. This is determined by the \(\delta\) and the \(\epsilon\) which is the radius.
</p>
\[\forall \epsilon >0 \exists \delta >0 : f(B_a(\delta) \subset B_{f(a)}(\epsilon)\]
<p>
    The preimage defintion is:
</p>
\[ a \in B_a(\delta) \subset f^{-1}(B_{f(a)}(\epsilon))\]

    <h4>
        Definition
    </h4>
    <p>
        Open set \(A\subseteq M\) is <b>Open</b> in the metric space \(M\)
        if it is a union of open balls. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The set of all open sets in the metric space \((M,d)\) is called 
    a <b>metric topology on \((M,d)\)</b> which we call \(T(M,d)\)
    </p>

</div>
</div>
<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    We can then formulate continuity in terms of open sets:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;

    <h4>
       Theorem
    </h4>
    <p>
        \(f: (M_1,d_1) \to  (M_2,d_2)\) is continous if and only if 
        \(U \in T (M_1,d_1) \Rightarrow f^{-1}(U) \in T(M_1,d_1)\). 
    </p>
<p>
    This is the same as the definition above since the topology is a power set of the 
    metric space and so if says for ALL open sets this rule is obeyed. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>
    Open Set 
</h4>
<p>
    Open set is defined as a collection of each \(a \in X\) there exists an open ball 
    thats contained within the space \(X\)
</p>
<h4>
    Interior 
</h4>
<p>
    We say that the <b>Interior</b> or \(a \in \text{int}(X)\) if there exists an open balls
    \(\epsilon >0 \) such that \(B_a(\epsilon) \subset X\)
</p>
<h4>
    Exterior 
</h4>
<p>
    We say that the <b>Exterior</b> or \(a \in \text{ext}(X)\) is the maximal 
    open subset of \(M\) contained in \(X^c \Leftrightarrow\) the union of 
    a;ll open subsets of \(X^c\) which is the same \(\text{int}(X^c)\)
</p>
<h4>
    Limit Point 
</h4>
<p>
    We say that \(a\) is a <b>limit point </b> of \(X\) if the open ball around the point 
    has some elements in \(X\) in other words for any open ball centered at 
    \(a\) we have that \(B_a(r) - \{a\} \cap X \neq  \emptyset\)
</p>
<p>
    The limit around it is called \(\text{lim}(X), X'\)
</p>
<h4>
    Boundary Point 
</h4>
<p>
    The <b>boundary point</b> is the edge of a bound. Imagine taking the edge point and constructing a 
    open ball around it, for any open ball centered at that point there are elements in the set AND 
    out of the set. Thus the definition of boundary denoted by  \(\partial X\) defined by
</p>
\[\forall \epsilon > 0 : \begin{cases} 
B_a(\epsilon) \cap A \neq \emptyset \\
B_a(\epsilon) \cap A^c \neq \emptyset \\
\end{cases}\]
<p>
    We can piece together the entire space by:
</p>
\[M = \text{int}(X) \sqcup \partial(X)  \sqcup\text{cl}(X) \]
<h4>
    Closed Sets
</h4>
<p>
    The definition of the closed set compliment of the open. If \(A\) open then \(A^c\) is closed. 
</p>
<h4>
    Closure
</h4>
<p>
    The <b>closure</b> of \(X\) denoted by \(\text{cl}(X) \) or 
    \(\overline{X}\) is the set of all of limit points of \(X\)
</p>
<p>
    Or it can be described as the union of boundary and the interior. \(\overline{A} = A \cup \partial A\)
</p>
<h4>
    Isolated Point
</h4>
<p>
    Imagine carving out a ball around a point \(a\) 
    such that there exists a ball with \(r_0 >0\)
    \(B_a(r_0) \cap X = \{a\}\), this implies that carving out the limit around the point 
    is also possible which leaves just \(a\). 
</p>

    <h4>
       Theorem
    </h4>
    <p>
       A set \(X\) with respect to \(T(M,d)\) if and only if \(X = \overline{X}\)
    </p>
    <p>
        This should make sense because 
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>
    Bounding Spaces
</h4>
<p>
    We can define the "diameter" of a some subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) 
    where it is the maximum distance between any point in the subspace. 
</p>
\[\text{diam}(C)  = \text{sup}_{x,y\in C}d(x,y)\]
<p>
    We can also define the distance between subspaces as the smallest distance. 
</p>
\(d(A,B) = \text{inf}_{x\in A, y \in B}d(x,y)\)

    <h4>
       Theorem
    </h4>
   <p>
       Let \(C\) be some arbitrary subset of the metric space then the function 
       \(d_C\) is continous. 
   </p>
   <p>
       \(d_C\) is defined:
   </p>
   \[d_C: M \to \mathbb{R}\quad d_C(x):= d(\{x\},C)\]
</div>

<p>
    Okay now my teacher decides to introduce compactness in the first lecture? 
    Lol aight so we have this: 
</p>
<div style=" border-width: 5px; border:solid; border-radius: 20px;
border-color: #b80707; ">
<div style="padding-left: 3%;padding-right: 3%;">
    <h4>
       Definition
    </h4>
  <p>
      We define that \(C \subset \mathbb{R}\) is <b>compact</b>
      if and only if for any arbitrary covering for \(C\) there 
      is a fininte number of subcovers. 

  </p>
  <p>
      Formally we write:
  </p>
  \[C \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^n B_{a_k}(r_k)\]
</div>
</div>
<p>
    Here are a number of equivalent definitions: 
</p>

<div style="padding-left: 3%;padding-right: 3%;">
    <h4>
       Compactness 
    </h4>
    <p>
        <b>Compactness</b>
        if and only if for any arbitrary covering for \(C\) there 
        is a fininte number of subcovers. 
  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Countably Compactness</b>
       for every infinite subset of \(M\) there is a limit point. 
  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Sequentially Compactness</b>
      for every sequence in \(M\) has a convergent subsequence
  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Complete and Totally Bounded</b>
     every cauchy sequence converges and is totally bounded. Specifically 
     \(\forall \epsilon >0 \exists \) a finite number of open balls of radius \(\epsilon\) 
     that covers \(M\).
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    Complete is a more general class of compactness. 
</p>
<h4>
    Dense
</h4>
<p>
    We can call something is <b>Dense</b> if \(\overline X = M\).
    Intuitively this means that you can never 
    find a two points such that there doesnt exist an open ball where they intersect 
    each other. In other words there is always something in between. 
</p>
<h4>
    Nowhere Dense
</h4>
<p>
    We call this nowhere dense if for every open ball in \(M\)
    consisting of points entirely from \(X^c\). Which is the same as \(\text{int}(X^c)\). 
    
</p>
<p>
    This makes intuitive sense because for any point in the set you can always find an exact region 
    where something "ends" then clearly its not dense. If it were dense then you shouldn't be able to find this "boundary".

    <h4>
       Lebesgue Number 
    </h4>
  <p>
      The Lebesgue number which is \(\delta > 0 \) as the
       number for the covering \(\mathcal{U}\) if \(X \subseteq M\)
       and that \(\text{diam}(X) < \delta \Rightarrow \exists \alpha = \alpha(X) \in A\) 
       such that \(X \subseteq U_{\alpha}\)
  </p>
  <h4>
    Lebesgue Number Theorem
 </h4>
 <p>
    Given any open covering \(\mathcal{U}\) of a compact metric space
    \(M\) ,there exists a Lebesgue number for \(\mathcal{U} \) .

<p>
    Now it gets wild lmao

<h4>
    Category of Metric Spaces
</h4>
<p>
    We know that any compact metric space is complete. There are non-compact metric spaces 
    which are also complete. The calss of complete metric spaces is much more general and this crucial property is: 
    Baire category theorem.

       Definition

      A subset \(X\) of the metric space is said to be the first category if it is a countable

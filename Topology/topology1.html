<h4>
    Remainder: Metric Spaces
</h4>
<p>
If we say that \(X\) is a subset of the metric space 
\((M,d)\)
</p> then \((X,d_x)\) is also a <b>metric subspace </b>
and the <b>Induced metric topology</b> is \(T(X,d_x\). 
<p>
    We say that two metrics \(d, D\) are the same on the space 
    \(M\)
</p>
<li>
    Strongly Equivalent: \[C_1d(x,y) \leq D(x,y) \leq C_2d(x,y), \forall x,y\in M\]
</li>
<li>
    Topologically Equivalent: 
    \[T(M,d) = T(M,D)\]
</li>

    <h4>
       Definition: Topology
    </h4>
<p>
    A subset \(\tau = \tau_x\) of \(\mathcal{P}(X)\)
    is called a topology on \(X\) if it satisfies these conditions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        \(\emptyset\) and \(X\) are in \(\tau\)
    </li>
    <li>
        If \(U_1,U_2 \in \tau\) then \(U_1 \cap U_2 \in \tau\)
    </li>
    <li>
        If \(U_\alpha \in \tau\) for all \(\alpha \in A\)
        then \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_\alpha \in tau\)
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The elements of \(\tau \) are open sets on \(X\) and the pair 
    \((X,\tau)\) is called the <b>topological space</b>. 
    Typically we say ommit the \(\tau\). 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    Some examples, we see that \(\{\emptyset,X\}\) and \(\mathcal{P}(x)\) 
    are topologies on \(X\). The first one being the trivial topology called \(\tau_a\) 
    and the second being the discrete topology called \(\tau_b\)
</p>
<p>
    We also know that \(\mathcal{P}(x) = T(X,d_{discrete})\), now 
    the question is for any topological space is what if 
    \(\tau = T(X,d)\)? If such a \(d\) on \(X\) exists, then the topological space 
    is called metrizable topological space. 
</p>
<H4>
    Continous Maps
</H4>
<p>
<b>Continous</b> if the preimage of any open set is an open set. Or if its closed then the 
preimage is closed. 
</p>
<p>
    Open if the image of an open is open. Closed if any image of closed set is also closed. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Homeomorphism: 
    </b>if it is a bijection, which is continous and open at the same time. Then \(f\) is also a closed map.

    <h4>
       Definition: Induced Topology
    </h4>
<p>
    For a subset \(Y\) of a topological space \((X,\tau)\) we define the induced topology on \(Y\)
    to be the subset \(\tau_Y\in \mathcal{P}(Y) \) such that: \[A\in \tau_Y \Leftrightarrow A = U\cap Y, U\in \tau\]
</p>
<p>
    We want a new definition for open sets: we define it as:
</p>
<p>
    For a subset \(Y\) of a topological space \(X\) define befine its <b>Open neighborhood</b>
    to be an open set containing \(Y\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Interior: </b> the maximal open subset of \(X\) contained in \(Y\) \(\Leftrightarrow \)
    the union of all opensubsets of \(Y\). 
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Isolated points \(Y^{iso}\):
    </b> the subset of \(Y\) such that for each of its points there exists an open neighborhood which contains no 
    other points from \(Y\). 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Limit points </b>\(Y^{lim} = Y'\): the subset of \(X\) such that 
    for each of its points \(a\) any open neighborhood of \(a\)
    contains at least one point of \(Y\) different from \(a\). 
</p>
<p>
    <b>closure </b>\(cl(Y) = \overline{Y}\)
    defined as \(Y\cup Y^{lim} = Y^{iso}\sqcup Y^{lim}\)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Exterior</b> is the maximal openset of \(X\) contained in the 
    compliment of \(Y\). Same as the union of all open sibsets of 
    \(Y^C\) which is the maximal subset. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Boundary \(\partial (Y)\)</b> for each point of \(a\) 
    such that the open neighborhood has both a point inside and a point outside. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Dense</b> we will define as \(\overline{Y}=X\). The closure of a subset 
    os the entire space. Any open set of \(X\) it exists a point from \(Y\). 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Nowhere Dense</b> if \(\text{int}(\overline{Y})= \emptyset\) that is \(X =X\ \emptyset\). 
</p>
<p><b>
    \(\tau_1\) is coarser/weaker/smaller
</b> than \(\tau_2\) if \(\tau_1\subseteq \tau_2\). Finer or stronger 
if its the other subset direction.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>
    After defining all of this we can also find the smallest topology 
    or the coarsest topology. 
</p>
<p>
    \(T\langle S \rangle\) equals the intersection of all topologies on 
    \(X\) containing all elements from \(S\).

    <h4>
       Definition: Subbasis
    </h4>
<p>
    A subset \(S\) in \(\mathcal{P}(X)\) is called a subbasis for 
    \(\tau\) if \(\tau = T\langle S\ rangle\). In this case, we can say that 
    \(\tau\) is generated by \(S\) thus \(S =S(\tau)\)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    We can introcue a topology on the product set \(\prod X\).
</p>
<p>
    First we can consider the set of all projection maps: \(\{\pi_\alpha: X\to X_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}\) 
    and the set \(S=\{\pi^{-1}_\alpha(U_\alpha) | U_{\alpha}\in \tau_{\alpha},\alpha \in A\}\). 
</p>
<p>
    The topology \(T\langle S \rangle \) is generated by \(S\) is called 
    the product topology. \(\tau = \prod_{\alpha \in A}\tau_\alpha\)
</p>
<p>
    We say that \(B\subseteq \tau\) is a basis for \(\tau\) if an open set of \(X\)
    is a union of elements from \(B\) in this case we can write \(B = B(\tau)\) and that 
    \(\tau = T(B)\).
</p>

    <h4>
       Theorem
    </h4>
<p>
There exists a topology \(\tau\) on \(X\) such that \(\tau = T(B) \) 
and \(B = B(\tau)\) if and ONLY if \(X = \bigcup B\) for any \(B_1, B_2 \in B:\)
</p>
\[a \in B_1 \cap B_2 \Rightarrow \exists B(a) \in B:a\in B(a) \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2\]
</div>
</div>
<h4>
    Prove Primes are Infinite
</h4>
<p>
    We can prove cool things now. For example the infinite primes!!!
</p>
<p>
    Let \(X = \mathbb{Z}\) be the set of integers and let \(B\) be the set of all 
    bi-infinit arithmetic progressions then \(B \in B(X)\). 
</p>
<p>
Indeed then \(\mathbb{Z} = p\mathbb{Z}\cup \{1+\mathbb{Z}\}\cup \cdots \{(p-1)+p\mathbb{Z}\}\)
and if \(a\in \{a_1+nd_1| n\in \mathbb{Z}\}\cap \{a_2 + nd_2|n\in \mathbb{Z}\}\), then 
\[a\in \{a+nd_1d_2| n\in \mathbb{Z}\} \subseteq \{a_1+nd_1|n\in \mathbb{Z}\} \cap \{a_2+nd_2|n\mathbb{Z}\}\]
</p>
<p>
   Let us consider the topology \(\tau\) on \(Z\) with the basis \(B\). Observe that for any 
   \(p\in \mathbb{P}\) the set \(p\mathbb{Z}\) is both open and closed in \(\tau\). 
   We know for sure because the compliment \((p\mathbb{Z})^C\) is a union of \(p-1\) arithmetic progressions,
   corresponding to the non-zero remainders \(\text{mod }p\) and hence is open in \(\tau\).  
</p>
<p>
    Now suppose there were only finitely many primes. It implies that the set \(\bigcup_{p\in \mathbb{P}}p\mathbb{Z})\)
    would be closed. However the compliment of this set in \(X\) is a two element set \(1,-1\) which is not 
    open! Indeed it can not contain any bi-infinite arithmetic progression since it is finite. 
    Contradiction.

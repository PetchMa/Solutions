   <h3>
    Problem 1 (a)
   </h3>
   <p>Consider the polynomial \(p(z) = 3z^3-\pi z^2 +8\) where \(z_0 \in \mathbb{C}\) and that \(p(z_0)=0\) prove that \(\bar{z}\) is also a root. </p>
   
   <h4>
       Solution 
   </h4>
   <p>We know that \(p(z_0)\) gives a value of \(0\).</p>
   <p>If \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z}) = 0\) then \(p(\bar{z_0})=0\).</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>Let \(z = a+bi\) and \(\bar{z} = a-bi\) </p>
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z}) = p(a+bi) - p(a-bi)\]
   <p>We know that \(p(a-bi) =3(a-bi)^3-\pi (a-bi)^2 +8 \)</p>
   \[p(a-bi) =3(a^3 - i 3 a^2 b - 3 a b^2 + i b^3)-\pi (a^2 - 2 i a b - b^2) +8\]
   <p>We know that \(p(a+bi) =3(a+bi)^3-\pi (a+bi)^2 +8 \)</p>
   \[p(a+bi) =3(a^3 + i 3 a^2 b - 3 a b^2 - i b^3)-\pi (a^2 + i 2 a b - b^2) +8\]
   <p>Next we can simply subtract the two by each term. </p>
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = 3(i 3 a^2 b - i b^3)-\pi ( i 2 a b ) - (3(-i 3 a^2 b + i b^3)+\pi ( i 2 a b ) )\]
   <p>Notice how there are no real terms in this expression. However we're left with all the imaginary parts. 
       But we can notice that the values for the imaginary part of \(p(\bar{z_0})\) is the negative of \(Im(p(z_0))\) which is \(3(i 3 a^2 b - i b^3)-\pi ( i 2 a b )\).
      
   </p>
   \[Im(p(\bar{z_0})) = - Im(p(z_0))\]
<p> Since we know that \(p(z_0) =0\) the imaginary part must also equal to 0. </p>
\[Im(p(z_0)) = 0\]
   <p>Thus \(Im(p(\bar{z_0})) = 0\) is also true.</p>
   <p>Therefore... </p>
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = -Im(p(\bar{z_0})) - Im(p(\bar{z_0}))\]
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = 0\]
   <p>Since \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0})\) is always \(0\) for \(\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). Therefore, for values \(p(z_0)\), \(\bar{z_0}\) will always be a root under the assumption that \(z_0\) is also a root. 
   </p>
   <h3>
    Problem 1 (b)
   </h3>
   <p>Consider the polynomial \(p(z) = \alpha_3z^3-\alpha_2 z^2 +\alpha_1z+\alpha_0\) where \(z_0 \in \mathbb{C}\) and that \(p(z_0)=0\) prove that \(\bar{z}\) is also a root.
    \(\alpha_3, \alpha_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_0 \in \mathbb{R} \)
   </p>
   <h4>
    Solution - Same method

    <p>We know that \(p(z_0)\) gives a value of \(0\).</p>
   <p>If \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z}) = 0\) then \(p(\bar{z_0})=0\).</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>Let \(z = a+bi\) and \(\bar{z} = a-bi\) </p>
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z}) = p(a+bi) - p(a-bi)\]
   <p>We know that \(p(a-bi) =\alpha_3(a-bi)^3-\alpha_2(a-bi)^2 +\alpha_1(a-bi) +\alpha_0 \)</p>
   \[p(a-bi) =\alpha_3(a^3 - i 3 a^2 b - 3 a b^2 + i b^3)-\alpha_2 (a^2 - 2 i a b - b^2)+\alpha_1(a-bi) +\alpha_0\]
   <p>We know that \(p(a+bi) =\alpha_3(a-bi)^3+\alpha_2(a-bi)^2 +\alpha_1(a-bi) +\alpha_0 \)</p>
   \[p(a+bi) =\alpha_3(a^3 + i 3 a^2 b - 3 a b^2 - i b^3)-\alpha_2 (a^2 + i 2 a b - b^2)+ \alpha_1(a+bi) +\alpha_0\]
   <p>Next we can simply subtract the two by each term. </p>
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = \alpha_3(i 3 a^2 b - i b^3)+\alpha_2 ( i 2 a b ) +\alpha_1(2bi) - (\alpha_3(-i 3 a^2 b + i b^3)-\alpha_2 ( i 2 a b ) )\]
   <p>Notice how there are no real terms in this expression. However we're left with all the imaginary parts. 
    But we can notice that the values for the imaginary part of \(p(\bar{z_0})\) is the negative of \(Im(p(z_0))\) which is \(\alpha_3(i 3 a^2 b - i b^3)+\alpha_2 ( i 2 a b ) +\alpha_1(2bi)\).
   
</p>    
</p>
\[Im(p(\bar{z_0})) = - Im(p(z_0))\]
<p> Since we know that \(p(z_0) =0\) the imaginary part must also equal to 0. </p>
\[Im(p(z_0)) = 0\]
<p>Thus \(Im(p(\bar{z_0})) = 0\) is also true.</p>
<p>Therefore... </p>
\[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = -Im(p(\bar{z_0})) - Im(p(\bar{z_0}))\]
\[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = 0\]
<p>Since \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0})\) is always \(0\) for \(\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). Therefore, for values \(p(z_0)\), \(\bar{z_0}\) will always be a root under the assumption that \(z_0\) is also a root.

   <h3>
    Problem 1 (b) Extended 
    </h3>
    <p>Consider the polynomial \(p(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k z^k\) where \(z_0 \in \mathbb{C}\) and that \(p(z_0)=0\) prove that \(\bar{z}\) is also a root.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Solution - Same method
    </h4>
    <p>We know that \(p(z_0)\) gives a value of \(0\).</p>
   <p>If \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z}) = 0\) then \(p(\bar{z_0})=0\).</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>Let \(z = a+bi\) and \(\bar{z} = a-bi\) </p>
 
   \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z}) = p(a+bi) - p(a-bi)\]
    <p>We know that...</p>
    \[p(a+bi) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k (a+bi)^k\]
    <p>We can expand based on the binomial theorem. </p>
    \[p(a+bi) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k \sum_{t=0}^k {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(bi)^t\]
    <p>We know that for the real part of this value, that \(t\) must be <b>even</b> or else the imaginary part is still left in. Thus if we take \(Re(p(a+bi))\)
    the result will only contain the components where \(t\) is an even value. </p>
    <p>Now we compute the complex conjugate. </p>
    \[p(a-bi) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k (a-bi)^k\]
    <p>We can expand based on the binomial theorem. </p>
    \[p(a+bi) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k \sum_{t=0}^k {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(-bi)^t\]
    <p><b>We look at the real part first. </b></p>
    <p>We know that for the real part of this value, that \(t\) must be <b>even as well</b> or else the imaginary part is still left in. Thus if we take \(Re(p(a-bi))\)
        the result will be ... </p>
        \[Re(p(a+bi)) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k \sum_{t=0}^{k/2} {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(bi)^{t*2}\]
        <p>The negative to an even power is always positive! And thus we arrive at the same result. </p>
        \[Re(p(z_0)) - Re(p(\bar{z})) = 0\]

     <p><b>We can then check the imaginary component. </b></p>   
     \[Im(p(a-bi)) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k \sum_{t=0}^{k/2} {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(-bi)^{t*2+1}\]
     <p>Since its always an odd degree, we can extract out the negative sign since it will always be negative given an odd degree. </p>
     \[Im(p(a-bi)) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k (-\sum_{t=0}^{k/2} {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(bi)^{t*2+1})\]
     \[Im(p(a-bi)) = -\sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k \sum_{t=0}^{k/2} {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(bi)^{t*2+1}\]
     <p>We know that the imaginary component is equal to zero for the case where \(p(a+bi)\). </p>
     \[Im(p(a+bi)) = \sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k (\sum_{t=0}^{k/2} {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(bi)^{t*2+1}) = 0\]
    <p>The real part of \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0})\) is always \(0\) for \(\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). 
        <p>Notice how there are no real terms in this expression. However we're left with all the imaginary parts. 
            But we can notice that the values for the imaginary part of \(p(\bar{z_0})\) is the negative of \(Im(p(z_0))\) which is \(\sum_{k=0}^n \alpha_k (\sum_{t=0}^{k/2} {k \choose t} a^{k-t}(bi)^{t*2+1})\).
           
        </p>    
    </p>
    \[Im(p(\bar{z_0})) = - Im(p(z_0))\]
    <p> Since we know that \(p(z_0) =0\) the imaginary part must also equal to 0. </p>
    \[Im(p(z_0)) = 0\]
    <p>Thus \(Im(p(\bar{z_0})) = 0\) is also true.</p>
    <p>Therefore... </p>
    \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = -Im(p(\bar{z_0})) - Im(p(\bar{z_0}))\]
    \[p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0}) = 0\]
    <p>Since \(p(z_0) - p(\bar{z_0})\) is always \(0\) for \(\forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). Therefore, for values \(p(z_0)\), \(\bar{z_0}\) will always be a root under the assumption that \(z_0\) is also a root.

   <h3>
    Problem 1 (c)
   </h3>
   <p>Prove that the polynomial \(p(z) = \alpha_3z^3-\alpha_2 z^2 +\alpha_1z+\alpha_0\) and \(\alpha_3, \alpha_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_0 \in \mathbb{R} \) that
       there must exist at least one real root for the polynomial. 
   </p>
   <h4>
    Proof by Contradiction
    </h4>
    <p><b>Assume that there exists 3 complex roots to a 3rd degree polynomial.</b></p>
    <p>We know that for every \(nth\) degree polynomial there has to be \(n\) roots ether Real, or Complex (can be unique or distinct roots) from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. This case 
        \(n=3\) thus there has to be \(3\) roots. 
    </p>
    <p>In part (b) we have shown that for a root \(z_0\) that gives a value with a real part equal to \(0\) that the conjugate also satisfy the same condition (at least in the \(n=3\) case). 

    </p>
    <p>Assuming that one has found 3 complex solutions, then it would imply that the third solution's conjugate is also a root to the polynomial. 
        Thus giving 4 solutions. But we know that for every \(nth\) degree
        polynomial there is only \(n\) solutions either unique or distinct. This implies that the polynomial has to be, at least, an 4th degree polynomial which contradicts the initial conditions. 

    </p>
    <p>\(\therefore \) it is not possible to have 3 complex solutions. If there isn't 3 complex solutions then at least 1 solution has to be a Real solution. Since the fundamental theorem 
        of algebra says there are always a total of 3 solutions for a 3rd degree polynomial. 
    </p>

        <p><b>Assume that there exists n complex roots to a nth degree polynomial. Where n is <i>Odd</i></b></p>
        <p>We know that for every \(nth\) degree polynomial there has to be \(n\) roots ether Real, or Complex (can be unique or distinct roots) from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

        <p>Assuming that one has found \(n\) complex solutions, then it would imply that the n solution's conjugate is also a root to the polynomial. 
            Thus giving \(n+1\) solutions. But we know that for every \(nth\) degree
            polynomial there is only \(n\) solutions either unique or distinct. This implies that the polynomial has to be, at least, an \(n+1\)th degree polynomial which contradicts the initial conditions.

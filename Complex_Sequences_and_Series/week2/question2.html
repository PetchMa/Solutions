   <h3>
    Problem 2 (a)
   </h3>
   <p>Consider the equation \(z^4 = z_0\) where \(z_0\) is some fixed complex number like \(1+2i\).
    Assume u and v are two roots: \(u^4 = z_0\) and \(v^4 = z0\). Prove that if you have \(u\)
    then you can build \(v\) by multiplying \(u\) by one of the roots of \(z^4 = 1\). That is,
    prove \(v = uw\) where \(w^4 = 1\).
   </p>
   <h4>
    Building New Roots
    </h4>
    <p>We know that \(e^{i\pi} = -1\) based off of Euler's identity. We know that any value raised to the even power will always be positive or 0. 
        Thus if \(w = -1\), then \(w^4=1\) satisfying the inital condition. Thus one value that \(w\) can take is \(w = e^{i\pi}\) 
    </p>
    <p>Let one root of \(z_0=r[\cos(\theta ) + \sin(\theta)] = re^{i\theta}\).</p>
    <p>Building a second root gives...</p>
    \[v = uw\]
    \[v = re^{i\theta}\cdot e^{i\pi}\]
    \[v = re^{i\theta + i\pi}\]
    \[v = re^{i(\theta +\pi)}\]
    <p>This second root is the following in cartesian form.</p>
    \[v = r[\cos(\theta +\pi) + \sin(\theta+\pi)]\]
    \[v = r[-\cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)]\]
    <p>This is a distinct root from \(u\) since...</p>
    \[u-v = r[\cos(\theta ) + \sin(\theta)] -r[-\cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)] \]
    \[u-v = 2r[\cos(\theta ) + \sin(\theta)]  \]
    <p>\(u\neq v\) since \(u-v \neq 0 \), in the case \(\forall \theta \not\in  \frac{4 π n - π}{4}, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(r \in \mathbb{R}\). 
        a perfect fourth. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>
    Proof
    </h4>
    <P>Prove that \(v\) is also a root of \(z_0\)</P>
    <p>We know that given the initial conditions of the question, \(v = uw\), as a method to build a new root. Given \(w^4=1\). We already shown previously that the new root
        built from the initial root \(u\) by multiplying \(w\) gives \(v= re^{i(\theta +\pi)}\)
    </p>
    <p>If \(v^4 - u^4 =0\) then \(\Rightarrow \) \(v^4 = u^4 \) which \(\Rightarrow v\) is a root of \(z_0\)</p>
    \[v^4 - u^4 = (re^{i(\theta +\pi)})^4 -(re^{i(\theta)})^4\]
    \[ = r^4e^{4i(\theta +\pi)}-r^4e^{4i(\theta)}\]
    \[ = r^4e^{i(4\theta +4\pi)}-r^4e^{i(4\theta)}\]
    <p>We can expand this into cartesian coordinates from polar.</p>
    \[ = r^4[\cos(4\theta +4\pi) + \sin(4\theta+4\pi)]-r^4[\cos(4\theta ) + \sin(4\theta)]\]
    <p>Since we're adding \(4\pi\), we know that this will bring the angle back to its original position since its a multiple of a full rotation. </p>
    \[ = r^4[\cos(4\theta ) + \sin(4\theta)]-r^4[\cos(4\theta ) + \sin(4\theta)]\]
    \[ = 0\]
    <p>Since \(v^4 - u^4 =0\), therefore \(v\) must also be a root to \(z_0\) under the assumption that \(u\) is already a root. </p>
    <h3>
        Problem 2 (b)
       </h3>
       <p>
           We know based on the polar coordinates that the newly built root is simply a full \(\pi\) rotation of the original root.

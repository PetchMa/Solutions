<h2>
Numbers of Various Sorts 
</h2>
<h3>
Problem 1.ii
</h3>
<p><b>Prove:</b> that \(1^3+2^3+4^3+...n^3 = (1+2+3+4+5+..+n)^2\) </p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^3 = (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2\]
<p><b>Prove by Induction.</b></p>
<h4>
    Base Case
</h4>
<p>We prove the base case. If \(\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^3 = (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2\), then \( \sum_{k=1}^{n}k^3 -(\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2 = 0\) for \(n=1\)</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^3 - (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2 = 1^3-1^2\]
\[= 0\]
<p>The base case is true. </p>
<p>Assume that \(S(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n}k^3 = (\sum_{k=0}^{n}k)^2\) is true for \(n\).</p>
<h4>
    Induction Step
</h4>
<p>Prove the \(n+1\) case. Let \(S(n) =\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^3  \) and \(S'(n) = (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2\). If \(S(n+1) = S'(n+1) \Rightarrow S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = 0\)</p>
<p>We know that \(S(n+1) = S(n)+(n+1)^3\)</p>
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = S(n)+(n+1)^3 -S'(n+1) \]
<p>We assumed that \(S(n) = (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2\)</p>
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = (\sum_{k=0}^{n}k)^2+(n+1)^3 - (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k)^2 \]
<p>Notice that the summation is basically a sum of natural numbers all squared. Since we proved that the sum of \(n\) natural numbers is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) we can sub for that. Same for the \(n+1\) case.</p>
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2+(n+1)^3 - (\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2})^2 \]
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = (\frac{n^2+n}{2})^2+(n+1)^3 - (\frac{n^2+3n+2}{2})^2 \]
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = \frac{n^4+2n^3+n^2}{4}+(n+1)^3 - \frac{n^4+6n^3+13n^2+12n+4}{4} \]
<p>Subtract the polynomials.</p>
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = \frac{-4n^3-12n^2-12n-4}{4}  +(n+1)^3\]
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = -n^3-3n^2-3n-1  +(n+1)^3\]
<p>Factor.</p>
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = -(n+1)^3  +(n+1)^3\]
\[S(n+1)-S'(n+1) = 0\]
\[\therefore S(n+1) = S'(n+1) \]
<p>Thus we've proven via induction that \(1^3+2^3+4^3+...n^3 = (1+2+3+4+5+..+n)^2\) is true.</p>
<h3>
    Problem 2.ii
</h3>
<p><b>Derive: </b> the formula for the following series. </p>
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 = 1^2+3^2+5^2 + .. (2n-1)^2\]
<p>We can expand the inner bracket</p>
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =\sum_{i=1}^n 4i^2-4i+1 \]
<p>We can break up the summation. </p>
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =\sum_{i=1}^n 4i^2-\sum_{i=1}^n4i+\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \]
<p>Move coefficents out of the summations</p>
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =4\sum_{i=1}^n i^2-4\sum_{i=1}^n i+\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \]
<p>Notice that these are just the sum of squares, the sum of natural numbers and the last is just adding 1 \(n\) times which is \( = n\)</p>
<p>We've previously proved the sum of squares and the sum of natural numbers so we just plug in.</p>
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =4(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6})-4(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}) +n\]
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =2(\frac{2 n^3 + 3 n^2 + n}{3})-(2n^2+n)\]
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =\frac{4 n^3 + 6 n^2 + 2n-6n^2-3n}{3}\]
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =\frac{4 n^3 -n}{3}\]
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1)^2 =\frac{n(2 n-1)(2n+1)}{3}\]
<p>This is the formula.</p>
<h3>
    Problem 3 d)
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Prove: </b>the binomial theorem which states the following: 
</p>
\[(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k}\]
<p>
<b>Proof by Induction.</b>
</p>
<h4>
    Base case
</h4>
<p>We prove the base case. If \(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k} = (x+y)^n, \quad n=1\), then \( \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k} - (x+y)^n = 0\) for \(n=1\)</p>
\[\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k} - (x+y)^n ={1\choose 0}x + {1\choose 1} y  - (x+y) = 0\]

<p>Therefore we proven the base case. </p>
<p>Assume that \(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k} = (x+y)^n\) is true for \(n\).</p>

<h4>Induction Step</h4>
<p>If the \(n+1\) step is true then, \((x+y)^{n+1} - \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n+1\choose k}x^ky^{n-k} = 0 \)</p>
<p>We rewrite the statement. </p>
\[(x+y)^{n+1} - \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n+1\choose k}x^ky^{n-k} =(x+y)^{n}(x+y) - \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n+1\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1} \]
<p>Sub in our assumption. </p>
\[ =(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k})(x+y) - \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n+1\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1} \]
<p>Distribute</p>
\[ =(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k})+(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}) - \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n+1\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1} \]
<p>We know the identity \({n+1\choose k} = {n\choose k-1}+ {n\choose k}\). We sub it in. </p>
\[ =(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k})+(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}) - (\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1}+ {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}) \]
<p><B>NOTE</B>: there is something wrong with our sum... we can't take \(k< 0\)! Nor can we take the \({n\choose n+1}\)... so we are going to deal with those two cases manually add them in. </p>
\[ =(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k})+(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}) - [\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n+1\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1} + {n+1\choose 0}x^0y^{n+1} +  {n+1\choose n+1}x^{n+1}]\]
\[ =(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k})+(\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}) - [\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1}+ \sum_{k=1}^{n}{n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}+  y^{n+1} +  x^{n+1}]\]
<p>Lets manipulate the first part to have the same limits. </p>
\[ =(\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k})+(\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1})+{n\choose 0}x^{0+1}y^{n-0}+{n\choose 0}x^0y^{n-0+1} - [(\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1}+ \sum_{k=1}^{n}{n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}+ y^{n+1} +  x^{n+1}]\]
\[ =(\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k})+(\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1})+xy^{n}+y^{n+1} - [(\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1}+ \sum_{k=1}^{n}{n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k+1}+ y^{n+1} +  x^{n+1}]\]
<p>We can subtract from the expression. </p>
\[ =\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k}+xy^{n} - [(\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1} +  x^{n+1}]\]
<p>Okay what if we wrote out the first few terms of each summation? What do we get??</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k} = {n\choose 1}x^{2}y^{n-1}+{n\choose 2}x^{3}y^{n-2}+....+{n\choose n-1}x^ny^1 + {n\choose n} x^{n+1}\]
\[\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1} = {n\choose 0}x^1y^{n}+{n\choose 1}x^{2}y^{n-1}+{n\choose 2}x^{3}y^{n-2}+...+{n\choose n-1}x^ny^1 \]
<p>Notice how each term cancels out except for \({n\choose 0} xy^{n}\) and \({n\choose n} x^{n+1}\). Notice how those terms can be canceled as well! They appear in the equation above.Thus we get...
</p>
\[ =\sum_{k=1}^n {n\choose k}x^{k+1}y^{n-k}+xy^{n} - [(\sum_{k=1}^{n} {n\choose k-1}x^ky^{n-k+1} +  x^{n+1}] = x^{n+1}+xy^{n} -  x^{n+1} -xy^{n} \]
\[=0\]
<p>Therefore by induction we've proven the binomial theorem is true. </p>
<h3>
    Problem 3 e).i
</h3>
<p><b>Prove: </b>the following summation. </p>
\[\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}= 2^n\]
<p>We will prove using binomial theorem</p>

<p>We know that the binomial theorem is the following.</p>
\[(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}x^ky^{n-k}\]
<p>Notice that we can rewrite the expression is equal to ... </p>
\[\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}= \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} \cdot 1\cdot 1\]
\[\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}= \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} \cdot 1^k\cdot 1^{n-k}\]
<p>Its in the form of the binomial theorem and we can rewrite it as the following.. </p>
\[\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}= (1+1)^n\]
\[\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}= 2^n\]
<h3>
    Problem 6.i
</h3>
<p><b>Derive: </b>the general solution to the following sum of cubes  </p>
\[1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 +.... + n^3\]
<p>We start off with this function. We know that the following is true. Distribute it out.</p>
\[(k+1)^4 - k^4 = 4k^3+6k^2+4k+1\]
<p>What if we added up every value of \(k \in [1,n]\)? What would we get?</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n (k+1)^4-k^4 = (2^4-1^4)+(3^4-2^4)+(4^4-3^4).....+(n^4-(n-1))+((n+1)^4-n^4)\]
<p>Notice that every term cancels except for \((n+1)^4-1^4\). Thus we collapsed the sumation. </p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n (k+1)^4-k^4 = (n+1)^4-1^4\]
<P>But we also know that \((k+1)^4 - k^4 = 4k^3+6k^2+4k+1\) what if we plug that in? </P>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n 4k^3+6k^2+4k+1 = (n+1)^4-1^4\]
<p>Distribute the summation.</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n 4k^3+\sum_{k=1}^n6k^2+ \sum_{k=1}^n4k+ \sum_{k=1}^n1 = (n+1)^4-1^4\]
\[4\sum_{k=1}^n k^3+6\sum_{k=1}^nk^2+ 4\sum_{k=1}^nk+ \sum_{k=1}^n 1 = (n+1)^4-1^4\]
<p>Notice that we know what the sum of squares and sum of natural numbers equals to. </p>
\[4\sum_{k=1}^n k^3+6 \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}+ 4\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+ n = (n+1)^4-1^4\]
<p>We can rearrange. </p>
\[4\sum_{k=1}^n k^3+n(n+1)(2n+1)+ 2n(n+1)+ n = (n+1)^4-1^4\]
\[4\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = (n+1)^4-1^4 - n -2n(n+1) - n(n+1)(2n+1) \]
\[\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \frac{(n+1)^4-1^4 - n -2n(n+1) - n(n+1)(2n+1) }{4} \]
<p>We simplify and we get...</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n k^3  = \frac{1}{4} n^2 (n^2 + 2 n + 1) = (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2\]
<p>Thats the general formula for the sum of cubes. </p>

<h3>
    Problem 7
</h3>
<p><b>Show that: </b>the general solution to the following sum of powers to the \(p\) can be written as  </p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n k^p=1^p + 2^p +.... + n^p =  \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}+An^p + Bn^{p-1}+ ... \]
<h4>Proof by Induction.</h4>
<p><b>Base case</b></p>
<p>We can check the base case when \(p=1\), which we know from the general formula equals...</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n k^1=1 + 2 +.... + n =  \frac{1}{2}n^2+\frac{1}{2}n\]
<p>This evidently follows the form \(\frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}+An^p + Bn^{p-1}+ ... =\frac{n^{1+1}}{1+1}+An^p + Bn^{p-1}+ ... = \frac{n^{2}}{2}+An + B\)</p>
<p><b>Assume General case</b></p>
<p>Assume that for \(p-1\) and all cases \(< p-1\) also follows the form.</p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-1} =1^{p-1}  + 2^{p-1}  +.... + n^{p-1} =  \frac{n^{p}}{p}+An^{p-1} + Bn^{p-2}+ ... \]
<p><b>Induction Step</b></p>
<p>We prove the \(p\)th case. </p>
<p>We use the same method as before in problem 6. We know this is true from the binomial theorem.</p>
\[(k+1)^{p+1} - k^{p+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{p+1} {p+1\choose i}k^{p-i+1}\]
<p>If we added up everything such that ... </p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n (k+1)^{p+1}-k^{p+1} = (2^{p+1}-1^{p+1})+(3^{p+1}-2^{p+1})+(4^{p+1}-3^{p+1}).....+(n^{p+1}-(n-1))+((n+1)^{p+1}-n^{p+1})\]
<p>Notice that every term cancels except for \((n+1)^{p+1}-1^{p+1}\). Thus we collapsed the sumation. </p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n (k+1)^{p+1}-k^{p+1} = (n+1)^{p+1}-1\]
<p>We can plug in our equation from before. </p>
\[\sum_{k=1}^n (\sum_{i=1}^{p+1} {p+1\choose i}k^{p-i+1}) = (n+1)^{p+1}-1\]
<p>We can swap the summation notation. </p>
\[\sum_{i=1}^{p+1} (\sum_{k=1}^n {p+1\choose i}k^{p-i+1}) = (n+1)^{p+1}-1\]
\[\sum_{i=1}^{p+1}( {p+1\choose i} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1})) = (n+1)^{p+1}-1\]
<p>Notice we've broken it down to sum of various powers. </p>
<p>All we care about however is the sum for \(i=1\). Lets bring that out. </p>
\[( {p+1\choose 1} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p})) +\sum_{i=1}^{p+1}( {p+1\choose i} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1})) = (n+1)^{p+1}-1\]

<p>Since we only care about the sum of \(p\) powers. We rearrange for that sum.</p>
\[ {p+1\choose 1} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p} = (n+1)^{p+1}-1 - \sum_{i=1}^{p+1}( {p+1\choose i} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1}))\]
<p>Binomial theorem.</p>
\[ (p+1)\sum_{k=1}^n k^{p} =(\sum_{k=0}^{p+1} {p+1\choose k}  n^{p+1-k})-1 - \sum_{i=1}^{p+1}( {p+1\choose i} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1}))\]
<p>Notice that the term \(\sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1}\) we've already assumed to be capable of writting in the form \(\frac{n^{p}}{p}+An^{p-1} + Bn^{p-2}+ ...\)
    We know that the sum of polynomials will always be a polynomial. Thus \( \sum_{i=1}^{p+1}( {p+1\choose i} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1}))\) will also be polynomial.
    This satisfies the requirement that the general solution is polynomial. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We know that \(\sum_{k=0}^{p+1} {p+1\choose k}  n^{p+1-k}\) will contain the term \(n^{p+1}\). Which is the first term. </p>
<p>We can rearrange the leading coefficents into the following form. Which shows that the term \( \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}\) would thus be included.</p>
\[ \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p} = \frac{(\sum_{k=0}^{p+1} {p+1\choose k}  n^{p+1-k})-1 - \sum_{i=1}^{p+1}( {p+1\choose i} \sum_{k=1}^n k^{p-i+1}))}{p+1}\]
<p>Since the form only requires that it can be written with a leading term of \( \frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}\) followed by arbitray terms in a polynomial. We've proven that 
    for the \(p\)th term we will have the correct leading term followed by polynomials. Thus by induction we've proven that this argument is true.
</p>
<h3>
    Problem 8
</h3>
<p><b>Prove that every natural number is either even or odd.</b></p>
<p><b>Proof By Contradiction.</b></p>
<p>Definition of even is ... </p>
\[E = \{n\in\mathbb{Z}: 2n\}\]
<p>
    Definition of odd is...  
</p>
\[O = \{n\in\mathbb{Z}: 2n+1\}\]
<p>Assume \(\exists a \in \mathbb{N}: a \notin E \cup O\)</p>

<p>If \(a \notin E \cup O\) then \( a\notin \mathbb{Z}\)
    This because we know from the following proof 
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
    ----------------------------------------------
    <H4><b>Lemma 1 Proof by Induction</b></H4>
    <p><b>Base case</b></p>
    <P>Let \(k_{base} = \{1,2\}\)</P>
    <p>It is evident that \(k_{base} \subset E \cup O\) since \(k_1 \in O\) and \(k_2 \in E\) thus \(k_{base} \subset E \cup O\)</p>
    <p><b>General case</b></p>
    <p>Let the following set equal </p>
    \[k_n = \{-n,-n+1,...-1,0,1,...n-1,n\} \]
    <P>Assume that \(k_n \subset E \cup O \)</P>
    <p><b>Induction</b></p>
    <p>Let the following set equal</p>
    \[k_{n+1} = \{-n-1,-n,-n+1,...-1,0,1,...n-1,n, n+1\}\]
    <p>We can rewrite the set as the following. </p>
    \[k_{n+1} = k_n \cup \{-n-1, n+1 \}\]
    <p>We know that \( k_n  \subset E \cup O\) we just need to check if \(\{-n-1, n+1 \} \subset E \cup O\)</p>
    <p>Since we know that \(k_n  \subset E \cup O \Rightarrow n \in O \) or \(n \in E\)</p>
    <p><b>Case where \(n \in O\)</b></p>
    <p>That means that \(n\) can be written as \(2k+1, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z}\) which is a definition of odd numbers. 
        That would mean that \(n+1 = 2n+2 = 2(n+1)\). This is would always be even. Thus under this case \(n+1 \in E\) 
    </p>
    <p>We can rewrite \(-n-1 = -(n+1)\) in which case,  \(-(n+1) = -(2k+2), \quad k\in \mathbb{Z}\) which is still an even number.</p>
    <p><b>Case where \(n \in E\)</b></p>
    <p>That means that \(n\) can be written as \(2k, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z}\) which is a definition of even numbers. 
        That would mean that \(n+1 = 2k+1\). This is the definition of an odd number. Thus under this case \(n+1 \in O\) 
    </p>
    <p>We can rewrite \(-n-1 = -(n+1)\) in which case,  \(-(n+1) = -(2k+1), \quad k\in \mathbb{Z}\) which is still an odd number.</p>
    <p>Therefore \(\{-n-1, n+1 \} \subset E \cup O\). </p>
    <p>We can extend this argument to span all integers for \(n\) and thus by induction we can prove that \(\mathbb{Z} \subseteq E \cup O\) is true.</p>
    ----------------------------------------------

</div>
<p><b>Back to the proof by contradiction</b></p>
<p>Since we know that \(\mathbb{Z} \subseteq E \cup O\). If \(a \notin E \cup O \Rightarrow a \notin \mathbb{Z}\). Since \(\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \Rightarrow a \notin \mathbb{N}\)</p>
<p>Thus this contradicts the assumption that \(a \in \mathbb{N}\) thus \(a \) must be even or odd to be a natural number.</p>
<h3>
    Problem 17 a)
</h3>
<p><b>Prove that every composite number can be written as the product of prime numbers.</b></p>
<h4><b>Proof By Induction.</b></h4>
<p><b>Base Case</b></p>
<p>We know the first composite number thats not \(1\) is \(4\)</p>
<p>We can write \(4 = 2 \cdot 2\) which is a product of prime numbers, thus proven the base case. </p>

<p>Assume that for \(\forall n\in \mathbb{N}, n > 1 \) and any composite number \(< n\) can be written as the product of only prime numbers. </p>
<p>\(n\) can be written as \(n = a_1a_2\) assuming that \(a_1a_2 \in \mathbb{N}\).</p>

<p>We can test if \(n+1\) can be written as a product of prime numbers. </p>
<p>We can write  \(n+1\) as a product \(n+1 = b_1b_2\) We know that \(b_1, b_2 < n+1 \) by themselves. Assuming that \(b_1,b_2 \in \mathbb{N}, b_1,b_2 \in  [2, \infty)\)</p>
<p>We also know that \(b_1, b_2 < n \). Here's the proof. </p>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
    ----------------------------------------------
    <H4><b>Lemma 1 Direct Proof</b></H4>
    <p>We can rewrite \(b_1 \) as \(\frac{n+1}{b_2}\) </p>
    <p>If \(n - \frac{n+1}{b_2} > 0 \) then \(b_1, b_2 < n \)</p>
    \[n - \frac{n+1}{b_2}  = \frac{b_2n - n-1}{b_2} \]
    <p>We know that the greatest lower bound for \(b_2\) is \(b_2=2\). We need to test for 
        the greatest lower bound in order to minimize the expression. 
    </p>
    \[n - \frac{n+1}{b_2}  = \frac{2n - n-1}{b_2} \]
    \[n - \frac{n+1}{b_2}  = \frac{n-1}{b_2} \]
 
    <p>We know every value is positive since \(n\) is composite and greater than 1. Thus its always true that  </p>
    \[n - \frac{n+1}{b_2} > 0\]
   <p>Thus \(b_1, b_2 < n \)</p>

</div>
<p>Since \(b_1, b_2 < n \) by the assumption in the first case, any composite number \(< n\) can be written as the product of only prime numbers.
Thus \(b_1,b_2\) can be written as a product of only prime numbers,\( \Rightarrow n+1\) can also be written as a product of only prime numbers.   </p>
<p>Thus by induction every composite number can be written as the product of prime numbers.</p>

    Problem 17 c)
</h3>
<p><b>Prove that \(\sqrt[2]{n}\) is always irrational unless \(n = m^l\) for some \(m\in \mathbb{N}\).</b></p>
<h4>Proof by Contradiction.</h4>
<p>If \(\sqrt[l]{n}\) where to be rational then it can be written in lowest form \(\frac{p}{q}\) such that \(p,q\) are relatively prime. </p>
\[\sqrt[2]{n} = \frac{p}{q}\]
\[q\sqrt[2]{n} = p\]
\[q^2n = p^2\]
<p>This suggests that \(n\) is a factor of \(p^2\). Thus we know that either \(n\) is divisible by \(p\) or  \(p\) is divisible by \(n\).
    This is because if \(n\) didn't satisfy any of those conditions, then it would mean there's at least 1 uncommon prime factor from both \(n\) and \(p\)
    which would mean there is at least 1 uncommon prime factor from both \(n\) and \(p^2\) since \(p^2\) has all the prime factors of \(p\) and would thus also contain the uncommon factor. 
But we know that   \(n\) is a factor of \(p^2\), thus   \(n\) is divisible by \(p\) or  \(p\) is divisible by \(n\).
</p>

    <p> 
    Lets write \(p\) as a product of the factor \(n\)
    and some number \(k\)\(p = nk\)</p>
    \[q\sqrt{n} =  nk\]
    \[q^2n =  n^2k^2\]
    \[q^2=  nk^2\]
    <p>This suggests that \(q^2\) has a factor \(n\) which suggests that \(n\) is divisible by \(q\) or  \(q\) is divisible by \(n\).</p>
    <p>If \(n|p\) and  \(q|n\). Then  \(q|p\) which is a contradiction that they're relatively prime. If \(n|p\) and  \(n|q\). Then  they have a common factor\(\frac{1}{n}\). 
        Contradiction that they're relatively prime. If \(p|n\) and  \(n|q\). Then \(p|q\) which is contradiction that they're relatively prime. 
        If \(p|n\) and  \(q|n\). Then  they have a common factor\(n\). 
        Contradiction that they're relatively prime. If \(p|n\) and  \(n|q\).</p>
    <p>
    Thus we've shown that \(\sqrt{n}\) cannot be written as a rational number, thus its irrational. </p>

    <h3>
    Problem 2
    </h3>
    <p><b>Consider:</b>\(g(x) =x^2\) and the function </p>
    \[ \begin{cases} 
      0, & y \in \mathbb{Q}\\
      1, &  y\in \mathbb{Q'}\\
   
   \end{cases}
\]
<h4>
Part A 
</h4>
<p>
    <b>Find all \(h(y) \leq y\)</b>
</p>
<p>We know that \(\forall y \in \mathbb{Q} [0,\infty)\) that \(y\geq 0\). The function \(h(y)\) sends y \(h(y) = 0\))
    Thus \(h(y) \leq y\). We also know that  \(\forall y \in \mathbb{Q'} [1,\infty)\) that \(y\geq 1\). The function \(h(y)\) sends y \(h(y) = 1\))
    Thus \(h(y) \leq y\)
</p>
<h4>
Part B 
</h4>
<p>
    <b>For which \(y\) does \(h(y) \leq g(y)\)</b>
</p>
<p>
We know that \(\forall y \in \mathbb{Q} \) that \(g(y) \geq 0\) because its a square. We know that \(\forall y \in \mathbb{Q} , h(y)=0\).
Thus  \(h(y) \leq g(y)\) In this case.
</p>
<p>
    We know that \(\forall y \in \mathbb{Q'}(-\infty, -1] \cup [1, \infty) \) that \(g(y) \geq 1\) because its a square. We know that \(\forall y \in \mathbb{Q'} , h(y)=1\).
    Thus  \(h(y) \leq g(y)\) In this case.
    </p>

<h4>
Part C
</h4>
<p>
    <b>What is \(g(h(z)) - h(z)\)?</b>
    <p>Since \(h(z)\) can only take on either \(1\) or \(0\). \(g(x)\) would thus only take on either \(1\) or \(0\). 
        Thus \(g(h(z)) - h(z) = 0\). No matter what number \(z\) takes on, the square of \(1,0\) is always the same.
    </p>
</p>
<h4>
Part D
</h4>
<p>
    <b>For which \(w\) is \(g(w) \leq w\)?</b>
    <p>
        We know that the product of numbers greater than 1 will always be greater than the factors of the product. Thus if \(|w|>1\) then \(w^2> w\). Not represented in the inequality.
    </p>
    <p>We know that if each factor is \(\leq 1\) then the product is less than its factors. \(|w|\leq 1 \Rightarrow w^2 \leq w\). Thus when \(w\in \mathbb{R}[-1,1]\) the inequality holds true. </p>
</p>
<h4>
Part E
</h4>
<p>
<b>For which \(\epsilon\) is \(g(g(\epsilon)) = g(\epsilon)\)?</b>
<p>
    We know that the expression says \((x^2)^2 = x^2 \) which implies \(x^2 =1\). We know then that the only 2 values \(\epsilon\) can take on is \(\epsilon = \pm 1\)

<h3>
    Problem 16 a)
</h3>
<p><b>Suppose  \(f\) satisfies \(f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)\) for all \(x\) and \(y\). Prove that \(f(x_1+x_2+...x_n) = f(x_1)+f(x_2)+...\)</b></p>
\[f(\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} x_k) =\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} f(x_k) \]
<h4>Prove by Induction</h4>
<p><b>Base case</b></p>
<p>We are told that the base case is true. It is stated that \(f\) satisfies \(f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)\) which implies \(f\) satisfies \(f(x_1+x_2) = f(x_1)+f(x_2)\)</p>

<p><b>General case</b></p>
<p>We assume that \(f\) satisfies \(f(x_1+x_2+...x_n) = f(x_1)+f(x_2)+...\)</p>
\[f(\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} x_k) =\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} f(x_k) \]
<p><b>Induction case</b></p>
<p>We can test to see if the \(n+1\) case holds up. Let \(y = x_1+x_2+...x_{n}\)</p>
\[f(x_1+x_2+...x_{n+1}) =f(y+x_{n+1})\]
<p>We know from the base case that this is true. </p>
\[f(x_1+x_2+...x_{n+1}) =f(y) + f(x_{n+1})\]
<p>Sub back the value for \(y\)</p>
\[f(x_1+x_2+...x_{n+1}) =f(x_1+x_2+...x_{n}) + f(x_{n+1})\]
<p>We already assumed that \(f(x_1+x_2+...x_n) = f(x_1)+f(x_2)+...\)</p>
\[f(x_1+x_2+...x_{n+1}) =  f(x_1)+f(x_2)+...+ f(x_{n+1})\]
<p>By induction we've therefore proven that this is true. </p>

<h3>
    Problem 19
</h3>
<p><b>Prove that there exists no function \(f,g\) such that...</b></p>
\[f(x)+g(y) = xy\]
<p>Or...</p>
\[f(x)g(y) = x+y\]
<h4>
    First relationship
</h4>
<p>We first prove the first relation does not allow \(f,g\) to be a function.</p>
<p>We know that the following is true.</p>
\[f(x)+g(0)=0\quad and \quad f(0)+g(y)=0\]
<p>Thus if we add them together, they must equal to zero.</p>
\[[f(x)+g(0)] + [f(0)+g(y)]=0\]
\[[f(x)+g(y)] +[f(0)+g(0)] =0\]
\[[f(x)+g(y)] +0 =0\]
\[f(x)+g(y)=0\]
<p>This shows that </p>
\[f(x)+g(y) = xy \quad and \quad f(x)+g(y)=0, \quad \forall x,y\in\mathbb{R}\]
<p>This is the issue. If we hold the function \(g\) constant such that \(g(\alpha)\).  </p>
\[f(x)+g(\alpha)=x+\alpha\]
<p>But we've also shown that \(f(x)+g(y)=0, \quad \forall x,y\in\mathbb{R}\)</p>
\[f(x)+g(\alpha)=0\]
<p>Since \(x\) can take on any value, \(x+\alpha \neq 0\). Thus \(f\) is not a function. Since the function can equal any real number 
    and 0 at the SAME time. </p>
<p> If we hold the function\(f\) constant such that \(f(\alpha)\).  </p>
\[f(\alpha)+g(x)=\alpha+x\]
<p>But we've also shown that \(f(x)+g(y)=0, \quad \forall x,y\in\mathbb{R}\)</p>
\[f(\alpha)+g(x)=0\]
<p>Since \(x\) can take on any value, \(x+\alpha \neq 0\). Thus \(g\) is also not a function. Since the function can equal any real number 
    and 0 at the SAME time. 
</p>

<h4>
    Second relationship
</h4>
<p>We know that the following is true.</p>
\[f(-x)g(x) =0\]
\[f(-y)g(y) =0\]
<p>What if we multiplied them together?</p>
\[f(-y)g(y) f(-x)g(x)=0 \]
\[f(-y) f(-x)g(y)g(x)=0 \]
\[(-x-y)(x+y)=0 \]
\[-(x+y)^2=0 \]
\[-(f(x)g(y))^2=0 \]
\[f(x)g(y)=0 \]
<p>This is the problem. We've previously defined that \(f(x)g(y) = x+y\)</p>
<p>If we hold one of these constant. </p>
\[f(x)g(\alpha) = x+\alpha\]
<p>We also know that its equal to 0 at the same time from our previous proof. \(f\) is not a function. Since the function can equal any real number 
    and 0 at the SAME time. </p>
    \[f(\alpha)g(x) = \alpha+x\]
<p>We also know that its equal to 0 at the same time from our previous proof. \(g\) is not a function. Since the function can equal any real number 
    and 0 at the SAME time. </p>
    <p>Therefore we've proven that neither of these definitions allow \(f,g\) to be a function.</p>


<h3>
    Problem 26
</h3>
<p><b>Suppose  \(f(g(x))=I\) and that \(h(f(x)) = I\) prove that \(h=g\)</b></p>
<p>We know the following is true. We use the identity property. [thanks to Mojan :)]</p>
\[(h \circ f) \circ g = h \circ (f \circ g)\]
\[I \circ g = h \circ I\]
<p>
    We replaced it with the indentity function. We can then conclude that these two are the same.
</p>
\[ g = h \]
<p><b>Second way of proving.</b></p>
\[h^{-1}\circ f\circ g\circ g^{-1}\circ f^{-1}\circ h (x) = x\]
<p>This is based on the associative property of composition.</p>
<p>We can also rewrite \(f(g(x)) = h(f(x))\) which we can then write as 
    \(h^{-1}(f(g(x))) = f(x) \). Thus we can replace
</p>
\[f\circ g^{-1}\circ f^{-1}\circ h (x) = x\]
<p>From this we can say that the inner composition is the inverse of the outer. </p>
\[f \circ g^{-1}= (f^{-1}\circ h (x))^{-1}\]
<p>We can say that the inverse is distributive because of this proof. </p>
\[f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}(g\circ f(x))=x\]
<p>We can also say that the following is true based on the grouping </p>
\[(f\circ g)^{-1}(g\circ f(x))=x\]
<p>Thus the following is true.</p>
\[(f\circ g)^{-1}(g\circ f(x))=f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}\circ (g\circ f(x))\]
\[(f\circ g)^{-1}f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}\]
<p>Thus if we go back and distribute it in. We get...</p>
\[f\circ g^{-1}= f\circ h (x)^{-1}\]
<p>Take the inverse of \(f\) on both sides. </p>
\[g^{-1}= h (x)^{-1} \Rightarrow g=h \]
<p>Proven.</p>

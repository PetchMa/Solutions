    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Intro: </b>Differential equations are a set of problems that trys to reverse the information loss due to differentiation. 
    When we take derivatives of functions we loose out on constants and thus naturally given a derivative it is difficult to get back the original equations. 
    </p>
    <p>In one such technique is the seperable differential equations. These are easy in terms of computing. Here is an example</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Problem: </b> Solve the following differential equation. 
    </p> 
    \[\frac{du}{dv} = \frac{2v\sqrt{1+u^2}}{u}\]
    \[\frac{u}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}du = 3vdv\]
    <p>We can take the integral from both sides. </p>
    \[\int\frac{u}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}du = \int 3vdv\]
    <p>We preform the u sub technique to solve the integral.</p>
    \[\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}dk = \int 3vdv\]
    \[2(u^2+1)^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{3}{2}v^2+C\]
    \[u = \sqrt{(\frac{3}{2}v^2+C)^2-1}\]
    <p>The ways to identify when the problems are seperable differential equations are when the parts of dy and dx can be seperated by itself. Sometimes
        however this may not be possible and requires additional methods to solve. For example a change in variables.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Problem: </b> Solve the following differential equation. 
    </p> 
    \[3x+y = y'\]
    <p>First we want to solve for the y' but we can change the variables to make this solvable using seperable methods. We let\(u =3x+y\)</p>
    \[u= 3x+y\]
    \[u= y'\]
    \[u-3x = y \]
    <p>We can treat u as a function and then take the derivative in respect to x</p>
    \[u'-3 = y'\]
    <p>Replace with u from what we set it as from before.</p>
    \[u'-3 = u\]
    \[u'-3 = u\]
    \[u'=u+3\]
    \[\frac{du}{dx}=u+3 \]
    <p>Notice how we seperated the variables to just this form.</p>
    \[\frac{1}{u+3}du=dx \]
    \[\int \frac{1}{u+3}du=\int dx \]
    \[\ln(u+3)+C=x+C \]
    \[u+3-3=Ce^x-3 \]
    \[u=Ce^x-3 \]

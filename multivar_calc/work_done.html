    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Intro: </b> The work done by a vector field can be though of as the area under the force vs displacement curve. That force is defined as the force
    field and the displacement is the length of the path between two points. However, since moving an object between two points within a vector field we can simply sum up the infinitely small lengths 
of the vector field path and the area underneath that path. This is exactly what the line integral is.</p>
\[W = \int_{c}\nabla f dr \]
\[W = \int_{c}F(r(t))\cdot r'(t) dt \]
<p>However whenever we approach these problems we need to make sure that the vector field is a conservative vector field. Depending on if the field is conservative, A.K.A </p>
\[Curl \space  \nabla f = 0\]
<p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Problem: </b>Find the work done by the force field to move the object \((1,1)\) to \((3,2)\). Defined by the function </p>
\[\vec{F} = \langle \frac{1}{2}xy^2, \frac{1}{2}x^2y \rangle\]
<p>We need to prove the that the work is a conservative vector field by checking the scalar curl of the vector field. We need to see if the two scalar curls are the same.</p>
\[\frac{\partial \vec{F_x}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial \vec{F_y}}{\partial x} = 0 \]
\[LS = \frac{\partial (xy^2)}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial(x^2y)}{\partial x}\]
\[LS = 2xy-2xy\]
\[LS = 0\]
\[RS= 0\]
\[LS = RS\]
<p>\(\therefore\) Vector field is conservative. Thus we don't need to need to know the path of the line. To evaluate the work done we just need to take the integral of the force field gradient</p>
<p>We should remember that the \(\vec{F} = \nabla f\) is simply a vector with the partial derivatives in respect to each component.</p>
\[\langle xy^2, x^2y \rangle = \langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\rangle \]
<p>Thus if we take the integral of any component of \(\nabla f\) we should get back \(f\).</p>
\[f = \int \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot dx\]
\[f = \int xy^2 \cdot dx\]
\[f = \frac{1}{2}x^2y2 + g(y)\]
<p>However, we're left with an unknown value, since we took the partial derivative in respect to x, we zero-out constants in terms of y. Thus we need to solve for \(g(y)\). This can be done because we know the following is true: </p>
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial \int \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot dx}{\partial y} \]
\[x^2y= \frac{\partial (\frac{1}{2}x^2y2 + g(y))}{\partial y}\]
\[x^2y =x^2y + g_y(y)\]
\[g_y(y) = 0\]
<p>The result is a constant value. This is okay because as long as it doesn't contain a variable, this will cancel out when we take the integral. </p>
\[g_y(y) =0\]
\[g(y) =k\]
\[f =\frac{1}{2}x^2y2 + k\]
\[\int_{c} F \cdot dr = \int_{c} \nabla f  \cdot dr\]
\[ = \int_{(1,1)}^{(3,2)} \nabla (\frac{1}{2}x^2y2+ k)  \cdot dr\]
<p>The integral will undo the gradient operation. Leaving us just with \(f\). We also know that this is a conservative vector field, meaning its path independent. Thus we can just resort to the fund. theorem and compute the values. </p>
\[\int_{c} F \cdot dr = f(1,1) - f(3,2) \]
\[w= \frac{35}{2} \]

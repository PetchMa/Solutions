    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Intro: </b>With second order nonhomogenous equations things get trickier. The right hand side does not equal to zero. The problem is we can't solve for a simple 
        r value like we did with homogenous differential equations. Here we need to burrow a few tricks which involves a bit of guess work. 
        This is the general form for this differential equation.  
    </p>
    \[ay''+by'=k(x)\]
    <p>However, what is important to notice is that this solution needs to also include the homogenous solution. This includes multiple parts.</p>
    <p>Notice the following statements.</p>
    \[ay''+by'+cy=0\]
    \[ay''+by'=k(x)\]
    \[ay''+by'=k(x) + ay''+by'+cy\]
    <p>The final statement is true and thus has a "mix" of solutions. This final solution is the general solution which is a mix of solutions.</p>
    <p>First we need part of solution. Set the left hand side for zero to solve the homogenous solution.</p>
    \[ay''+by'=0\]
    \[ar^2+br=0\]
    \[r(ar+b)=0\]
    \[r= 0\]
    \[r= \frac{-b}{a}\]
    <p>Since we get real roots we can get the following.</p>
    \[y_1(x) = e^{r_1x+c_1} + e^{r_2x+c_2}\]
    \[y_1(x) = c + e^{\frac{-b}{a}x+c_2}\]
    <p>Now we need to find the complementary solution to get the general solution. Then we can get the complement solution by taking guesses of the 
        possible higher order functions that would give the derivative of \(k(x)\)
    </p>
    <p>For example... if \(k(x) = 48x^2+24x+e^{-2x}\) we would guess the following: </p>
    \[Ax^2+Bx+C+De^{-2x}\]
    <p>For the polynomial partion we need to guess with polynomial to the same degree but contains the entire all the terms until the zeroth power. 
        Exponetials we need the same function but with a constant ahead of it to account for the disappearing constants when taking derivatives. 
    </p>
    <p>However, we also cannot have constants overlapping each other. This "mixes" the solution together making it hard solve. To 
        solve the problem we multiply part of the function by x. This takes out the overlapping. Notice in this case we do have an overlap
        thus we multiply the entire equation by x, as \(De^{-2x}\) and  \(Ax^2+Bx+C\).
    </p>
    \[y_c(x)= Ax^3+Bx^2+C+Dxe^{-2x}\]
    <p>Then we find the first and second derivative of the following equation. </p>
    \[y_c'(x)= 3Ax^2+2Bx+De^{-2x}-2Dxe^{-2x}\]
    \[y_c''(x)= 6Ax+2B-2De^{-2x}-2De^{-2x}-2xDe^{-2x}\]
    <p>Now we sub back this equation into the original equation we are given we can solve for the missing variables. After finding the values for these hidden
        variables we can simply state the following: 
    </p>
    \[y_p(x)=y(x)+y_c(x)\]
    <p><b>Probelm: </b> Solve the following differential equation. </p>
    \[y''+2y' =24x+e^{-2x}\]
    \[r^2+2r =0\]
    \[r=0, \space r=-2\]
    <p>Guess hidden variables for the compliment</p>
    \[k(x)= 24x+e^{-2x}\]
    \[y_c(x)= Ax+B+Ce^{-2x}\]
    <p>We need to take into account the overlap of variables.</p>
    \[y_c(x)= Ax^2+Bx+Cxe^{-2x}\]
    \[y_c'(x)= 2Ax+B+Ce^{-2x}-2Cxe^{-2x}\]
    \[y_c''(x)= 2A-2Ce^{-2x}-2Ce^{-2x}+4Cxe^{-2x}\]
    <p>Sub everything back in.</p>
    \[[2A-2Ce^{-2x}-2Ce^{-2x}+4Cxe^{-2x}]+2[2Ax+B+Ce^{-2x}-2Cxe^{-2x}]=24x+e^{-2x}\]
    \[2A-2Ce^{-2x}-2Ce^{-2x}+4Cxe^{-2x}+4Ax+2B+2Ce^{-2x}-4Cxe^{-2x}=24x+e^{-2x}\]

    <p>We can solve for the following and match the other side of the equation with the constants on the left side.</p>
    \[A=6\]
    \[C=\frac{-1}{2}\]
    \[b=-6\]
    \[y_p(x) = c_1+c_2e^{-2x}+ 6x^2-6x-\frac{1}{2}xe^{-2x}\]

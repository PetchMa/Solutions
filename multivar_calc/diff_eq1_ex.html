    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Intro: </b> What happens when the differential equation is multivariate? If a function that is described in the following
        form we could solve them.  
    </p>
    \[M(x,y) + N(x,y)y' =0\]
    <p>We can solve this differential equation if...</p>
    \[M_x(x,y) = N_y(x,y)\]
    \[\Psi_x(x,y) = M(x,y)\]
    \[\Psi_y(x,y) = N(x,y)\]
    <p>Since we can write the M, N as the partial derivative of the function \(\Psi\) we can simply integrate either side to get back the origianl
        function of \(\Psi\)
    </p>
    \[\Psi(x,y) = \int M(x,y)dx\]
    \[\Psi(x,y) = \int N(x,y)dy\]
    <p>Notice that exact differential equations are basical working with conservative vector fiels.\(\Psi(x,y) = f\) and \(\nabla f =
        \langle M(x,y), N(x,y)\rangle\)  since we know that \(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} -\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} = 0 \) which is the scalar
    curl of the vector field \(\nabla f \) </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px"><b>Problem: </b> Solve the following differential equation. 
    </p> 
    \[2xy^{-1}+2ye^{2x}-1 + (e^{2x}+y^2-x^2y^{-2})\frac{dy}{dx}=0\]
    <p>First we need to check if the differential equation is exact.</p>

    \[ M(x,y) =2xy^{-1}+2ye^{2x}-1 \]
    \[N(x,y) = e^{2x}+y^2-x^2y^{-2}\]
    
    \(LS= \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} -\frac{\partial N}{\partial x} \) 
    \(LS = -2xy^{-2} + 2e^{2x} -(2e^{2x-2xy^{-2}}) \) 
    \(LS = 0\) 
    <p>Therefore this is an exact differential equation. It is also a conservative vector field. Go forward and solve the differential
        equation.
    </p>
    \[\Psi(x,y) = \int M(x,y)dx\]
    \[= \int 2xy^{-1}+2ye^{2x}-1 dx\]
    \[\Psi(x,y)= x^2y^{-1}+ye^{2x}-x +h(y)\]
    <p>We need to solve for the constant in terms of another function of y. Take the derivative of this function in respect to y.</p>
    \[\Psi_y(x,y)= -x^2y^{-2}+e^{2x} +h'(y)\]
    \[\Psi_y(x,y)= N(x,y)\]
    \[N(x,y) = -x^2y^{-2}+e^{2x}+h'(y)\]
    \[e^{2x}+y^2-x^2y^{-2} = -x^2y^{-2}+e^{2x} +h'(y)\]
    \[h'(y) = y^2\]
    \[h(y) = \frac{1}{3}y^3\]
    \[\Psi(x,y)= x^2y^{-1}+ye^{2x}-x + \frac{1}{3}y^3+K\]
    <p>Then we make the entire left hand side \(\Psi = C\) equal a constant. </p>
    \[C= x^2y^{-1}+ye^{2x}-x + \frac{1}{3}y^3+K\]
    \[C= x^2y^{-1}+ye^{2x}-x + \frac{1}{3}y^3\]
    <p>The reason we can do this is because: </p>
    \[\Psi_x +\Psi_y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0\]
    \[\frac{d}{dx}\Psi(x,y) = 0\]
    <p>Since the derivative is zero, in respect to x, the function must be a constant and thus we can set C to the entire 
        multivariate function.

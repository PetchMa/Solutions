    How can we generalized the idea of a derivative from \(\mathbb{R}^n \to 
    \mathbb{R}^k\)? Recall the definition of differentiability 
    in the 1-D case. We say \(f\) is diffable at \(a\in\mathbb{R}\) and we call 
    the derivative \(f'(a)= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = f'(a)\). 
</P>
<p>
    We could think of it as rate of change. But this is not the best way to understand this. 
</p>
<p>
    Consider: \(f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}, f(x,y) = x^2+y^2\). This gives us a 
    bowl like shape. If we were asked the "rate of change" then what direction??? Which 
    way is our rate of change. 
</p>
<p>
    We define a directional derivative.

<h4>
    Definition: Derivative
</h4>
<p>
    \(f:A \to \mathbb{R}^k, A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is a subspace such that 
    \(\exists U \subseteq A\)open containing \(a\in A\).  Given \(u\in \mathbb{R}^n\) nonzero, 
    the directiona derivative of \(f\) in the direction of \(u\) is \(f'(a,u)= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+hu) - f(a)}{h}\)
</p>
<p>
    \(f\) is differentiable if all the directional derivatives exists. However 
    if it has a derivative in every dimension its not necessairly differentiable. Here is why. 
</p>
<p>
    Define a function: \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\) as 
    \[f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    
    \frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}, & (x,y)\neq 0,\\
    0,  & (x,y) =0
    \end{cases}\]
    This function is differentiable but not continous... But we've previously known that 
    a function must be continous if it is differentable. Problem. We can compute this "derivative"
</p>
\[f'(0) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(hu)-f(0)}{h} = \frac{\frac{(h^2u_1^2)(h^2u_2)}{h^4u_1^4+h^2u_2^2} - 0}{h}\]
\[

f'(x,y) = \begin{cases}
    
    \frac{u_1^2}{u_2^2}, & (u_2)\neq 0,\\
    0,  & (u_2) =0
    \end{cases}
\]
<p>
    The original function is discontinous. Pick \(\epsilon = \frac{1}{3}\) then for 
    each \(\delta >0\) then \(f(\delta, \delta^2) = \frac{1}{2}\). 
    Since \(f(0)=0\) then \(d(f(0), f(\delta, \delta^2)) = \frac{1}{2} > \epsilon\). 
    Thus it is not continous
</p>
<p>
    The issue is that there is not proper relationship between each of these directional derivatives. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Proper Definition:
    </b>
    Important. The rate of change is the SAME as the <b>linear approximation of a function.</b> The Derivative 
    would be an affine subspace, a plane that doesn't go necessairly goes through the origin. The new definition would be: 
</p>
\[\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{f(a+t)-\overbrace{(f(a)+f'(a)t)}^{\text{linear approx}}}{t} = 0\]
<p>
    The differencnce of the linear approximation to the function, =0 means its well approximated and thus it because 
    the derivative!
</p>
<p>
    The second derivative would be the second order polynomial approximation of the function. 
</p>
<p>
    Formally: \(f: A \to\mathbb{R}^k, A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(a\in A\) with \(U\subseteq A\) is 
    open containing the point. We call the \(k\times n\) matrix \(Df(a)\) the derivative of \(f\) at \(a\)
    if \[\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)-Df(a)h}{d(h,0)}=0,\quad h\in\mathbb{R}^n\]
    Once again the metric defines the distance. The derivative is now a <b>matrix</b>. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    Now you might be wondering what is this derivative matrix??? \(Df(a)\) has many nice properties, 
    specifically these:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Derivative is unique.
    </li>
    <li>
        Derivative are related to rates of change. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Theorem: \(f\) differentiable at \(a\) implies that \(f\) continous at \(a\)
    </li>
    <li>
        Derivative is linear. 
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    How do we find this matrix??? Notice something: \(f'(a,u) = Df(a)u\). If we picked a basis for \(\mathbb{R}^n\) 
    for \(u\). If the function is differentiable we can figure out the matrix columb by columb.

<h4>
    Definition: Partial Differentiation
</h4>
<p>
    The \(j\)th partial derivative of a differentiable 
    \(f\) at \(a\) is \(D_jf(a) = f'(a;e_j)\). We look at the standard basis. 
</p>
<p>
    How do we find \(D_j f(a)\)? We define \(\phi_j:
    \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\) as \(\phi_j(x) = f(a_1,a_2 \cdots a_{j-1},x,a_{j+1}\cdots a_n)\) where everything else is held 
    constant.
</p>
<p>
    This makes it the same the one dimensional case in computing the derivative. 
</p>
<p>
    If \(f:A\to \mathbb{R}^k\) is of the form \(f(x) = (f_1(x)\cdots f_k(x)\) then 
    \(Df(a))_{ij} = D_jf_i(x)\)
</p>
<p>
    The columns are the partial derivatives.

<p>
    We don't want to introduce more structure then it is needed and so 
    we do not want to simply use the inner product to define a norm. 
    The inner product helps with angles and such, so we stop using inner products 
    as metrics. 
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes proofs are easier with one metric over another. 
</p>
<p>
    Example we can use the \(\text{sup}\) metric. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Suggestion: </b>take what you see in analysis in one dimensional and then try 
    and generalize it. Think of the link in the one dimensional case. 
</p>
<p>
    Analysis cares about things being "close" and not the actual distance per say. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Ex) </b>you can restirct metrics to subsets. Once you do such, you get a <b>subspace</b>
these are now NOT the same as <b>linear subspace</b>. 
</p>
<h4>
    Def: \(\epsilon -\)Neighbourhoods
</h4>
<p>
We denote such as: \(U(x_0;\epsilon) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^n: d(x,x_0) < \epsilon\}\)
</p>
<p>
    Given the Euclidean metric we get a ball, if we use the \(\text{sup}\) metric we have a cube. 
</p>
<p>
    These intervals in analysis in 1 dimensional space are now described by these \(\epsilon -\)Neighbourhoods
</p>
<h4>
    Def: Open Set
</h4>
<p>
    A set \(U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is considered open if \(\forall x \in U, \exists \epsilon>0\)
    such that \(U(x; \epsilon) \subset U\). \(U(x,\epsilon)\) is also open. 
</p>
<p>
    We use these to measure the closeness.
</p>
<h4>
    Def: Closed set
</h4>
<p>
    \(A\) is closed if \(\mathbb{R}^n - A\) is open.
</p>

    <h4>
      Theorem
    </h4>
    <p>
        Suppose that \(Y\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) a subspace. Then \(U\subseteq Y\)
        is open in \(Y \Leftrightarrow U = U'\cap Y\) where \(U'\) is open. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea here is we add "cushioning" for the set \(U\) to wiggle around. 
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    We want to define the closed set in a better way:
</p>
<h4>
    Def: Limit Point
</h4>
<p>
    We say that \(x\in \mathbb{R}^n\) is a limit point of \(X\) if 
    for all \(\epsilon > 0 \)  then every deleted neighbourhood 
    \(U(x,\epsilon) - \{x\} \cap X \neq 0\). 
</p>
<h4>
    Def: Closure
</h4>
<p>
    The closure of \(X\) is the union of its limit points. Denoted by \(\overline X\)
</p>
<div style=" border-width: 5px; border:solid; border-radius: 20px;
border-color: #b80707; ">
<div style="padding-left: 3%;padding-right: 3%;">
    <h4>
      Theorem
    </h4>
    <p>
        Closure are closed. More specifically \(X\) is closed 
        if it is equal to its \(\overline X\). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Closed sets are closed under limits. 
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>
    Limits and Continuity
</h4>
<p>
    We can recall in the 1-D case that the limit 
    \(\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = y\) if by the \(\delta - \epsilon\)
    definition. 
</p>
<p>
    We can generalize this, we replace these with a metric: 
</p>
\[\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = y \Leftrightarrow \forall \epsilon >0 
\exists \delta > 0 : 0< d(x,x_0) < \delta \text{ then }d(f(x),y) < \epsilon\]
<p>
    This is one way to define the limit. We want to use the power of our sets and 
    specifically the \(\epsilon-\) neighbourhood. 
</body>
\[\forall \epsilon >0 
\exists \delta > 0 : \underbrace{0< d(x,x_0)< \delta}_{\text{deleted delta neigh}} 
 \text{ then }  \underbrace{d(f(x),y) < \epsilon}_{epsilon neigh}\]
 <h4>
     Definition: Limit [without \(\epsilon-\delta\)]
 </h4>
 <p>
     Suppose that \(X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n ,  Y \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k \)
     subspaces and \(f:X\to Y\) we say that \(\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = y\)
     if and only if \(\forall V \subseteq Y\) is open in \(Y\)
     containing \(y\) that \(\exists U \subseteq X\) open in \(X\) 
     containing \(x_0\) such that \(f(U-\{x_0\}) \subseteq V\)
 </p>
 <p>
     For any openset we can map it with \(f\) and it will fit inside of the open 
     set. 
 </p>
 <p>
     <b>Ex) </b>\(\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n, |x|\leq ||x| \leq \sqrt{n}|x|\).
 </p>
<h4>
    Continuity [without \(\epsilon-\delta\)]
</h4>
<p>
    \(f: X \to Y\) is continous at \(x_0\in X \Leftrightarrow 
    \forall V \subseteq Y\) open in \(Y\) containing \(f(x_0)\)
    that there \(\exists U \subseteq X\) open in \(X\) containing 
    \(x_0\) such that \(f(U) \subseteq V\).

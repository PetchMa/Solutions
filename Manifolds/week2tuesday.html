    <h4>
        Open Covers
    </h4>
    <p>
        We say that \(U = \{A_\alpha\}\) is an open cover 
        of \(X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) if the \(A_\alpha\) 
        are open and that the union of them all covers the subset. 
    </p>
    <p>
        \(X\) is compact \(\Leftrightarrow \)every open cover
        there is a finite number of sub covers to conver \(X\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Intuition: </b>there are two ways to think of \(\mathbb{R}^n\)
        one in the linear algebra way with vectors. We can also think 
        of as a metric space, we want to ignore the points but 
        look at the open neighborhoods which is captured by metrics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The most fundemental parts of an metric spaces are these open sets, and thus 
        it is natural to define things based on the finite collection of these fundemental 
        building blocks of these metric spaces
    </p>

   <b>Lemma: </b> We know that the subset \(X\subset \mathbb{R}^n\) is compact , \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) is continous 
    then \(f\) is compact. 
</p>
<p>
We know that the function is continous thus, for any open set \(A_\alpha\) we know that 
\(F(x) \subseteq \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha \Rightarrow X 
\subseteq \bigcup f^{-1}(A_\alpha)\) open cover for \(X\).

    <p>
        Define A subspace \(X\) is bounded if \(X \subseteq B(0;M)\)
        for some \(M \in \mathbb{R}\). Where \(B\) denotes a ball. 
    </p>
    <p>
        \(X\) is compact \(\Leftrightarrow \)\(X\) is closed and bounded. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof \(\Rightarrow\):
        </b> Whenever we deal with these proofs, we come up with a clever open cover such that the results come for free. 
    Start to prove boundedness. Pick opencover thats concentric 
    "balls" and since there is a finite number of these the set is bounded 
    \(A_\alpha = \{B(0,m)\}:m\in \mathbb{N}\). We know that these balls 
    will cover all of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), however theres some finite number of these, 
    we say that the subset is bounded. 
    
    </p>
    <p>
        To show closed, we prove the compliment is open.
        We want to show that for any point there exists a ball around it in 
        the compliment. We want to make these concentric balls smaller 
        and smaller. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We center the ball we make it smaller and smaller. We 
        want to define the exterior of the balls to be the open sets. 
        \(V_k =\{z\in \mathbb{R}^n: d(y,z) > \frac{1}{k}\}\). This gives us the 
        exteiror of the point. So we have an open cover for \(X\). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Compactness \(\Rightarrow X \subseteq \bigcup^l_{i=1} V_k = V_{max\{k_i\}}\)
         since these shells are gets smaller and smaller, \(X\subseteq V_k\) where 
         \(k=max\{k_i\}\) then \(d(x,y) > \frac{1}{k}\) such that 
         \(\forall x \in X.\) Hence \(U(y, \frac{1}{k}) \cap X =\emptyset). 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Extreme Value Theorem: </b> \(f: X \to \mathbb{R}\) 
        continous and \(X\) compact \(\Rightarrow f\) attains its max and min. 

    </p>
    <p>

  
   <b>
       \(\epsilon-\)neighbourhood Theorem:   </b> is how one can think of 
       compact sets. We can think of it as big "points", if you zoom 
       out enough they look at a point.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose that \(X\) is compact in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) we can define a quantity
        called the \(\epsilon-\) neighbourhood of \(X\) as \(U(X;\epsilon) = \bigcup_{x\inX}U(x,\epsilon)\). 
        We're basically making the \(\epsilon\) larger bound.

    Recall that a function for \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) we proved that \(f\) is continous at 
    \(a\) if and only if each \(f_i\) is continous at \(a\) where \(f(x) = [f_1(x)\cdots f_k(x)]\)
    </p>
    <p>
    The limits for each componenet the limit must approach to the value then it implies that the limit 
    will be the same for the overall.

		<h4>
		Theorem 
		</h4>
		<p>
		If \(A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) a subspace and \(f:A \to \mathbb{R}^k\) then \(f\) is differentiable at 
		at \(a \in A \Leftrightarrow f_i\) differentiable at \(a\). 
		<p>
		<b>
			Proof:
		</b>
		 \(f\) is differentiable at \(a \Leftrightarrow \exists B\) a \(k\times n \) matrix with 
		 \[\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a) -Bh}{|h|}=0\]
		</p>
		</p>
		Given a \(k\times n\) matrix \(B\) define that \(F^B(hh) = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a) -Bh}{|h|}\)
	<p>
	Note that each of the \(F_i^B(h) = \frac{f_i(a+h)-f_i(h)-B_ih}{|h|}=0\)

We will define some new notation to help us with this big theorem. Class of functions, we say that
\(f:A\to\mathbb{R}^k\) is of class \(C^1\) on \(A\) if for each \(i\in \{1\cdots k\}\) and 
\(j\in \{1\cdot n\}\) \(D_j f_i\) exists and is continous on \(A\). 
</p>
<p>
\(f:A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^k\) then \(f_i: A \subseteq \mathbb{R^n}\to \mathbb{R}\) where
that \(Df_i(a)\) is a \(1\times n\) matrix where it is a point. We can think of \(D_j f_i\) as a map from 
\(A\to \mathbb{R}\). 
	</p>
<p>
We cannot think of the entire thing as a function anymore, each individual compoenent gives rise to a function. 
This is because the ENTIRE derivative gives out a MATRIX instead now. Example: 
	</p>
	\[f(x,y) = (x^2y,x-y,3xy)\]
<p>
For each of these we can compute the following:	
	</p>
	\[f_1(x,y) = x^2y\]
	\[f_2(x,y) = x-y\]
	\[f_3(x,y) = 3xy\]
<p>
	Thus we get the following:
	</p>
	\[Df(x,y) = \left[ \begin{matrix}
	2xy & x^2\\
	1 & 0-1 \\
	3y &3x \\
	\end{matrix}\right]
	\]
<p>
\(Df\) maps to \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and maps to a matrix. 	
	</p>
<p>
	If each of the individual functions 
	are existent and continous then it is class \(C^1\). 
	</p>
<p>
We say that something is of class \(C^r\) on \(A\) if \(D_jf_i: A\to \mathbb{R}\) then it is of 
class \(C^{r-1}\). 
	</p>
	<p>
	We say that things are \(C^\infty\) if it is infinitly differentiable.

		<h4>
		Theorem 
		</h4>
		<p>
		Let \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) be an open subspace and \(f:A\to \mathbb{R}^k\) be of
		class \(C^1\). Then \(f\) is differentiable on \(A\), in other words \(Df(a)\) exists 
		\(\forall a\in A\). 
		<p>
		<b>
			Proof:
		</b>
		Let \(a\in A\) since \(A \) open, \(\exists \epsilon > 0 \) such that 
		\(C (a,\epsilon)\subseteq A\). Let \(h=(h_1 \cdots h_n)\in \mathbb{R}^n\) with 
		\(|h| < \epsilon \) for each \(j\in \{1\cdots n\}\) define 
		</p>
		<p>
		We will now define a cube! We will travel along each of the basis directions and this will 
		for a "cube" like strucutre. 
		</p>
		\[p_0 = a\quad p_j = a+\sum_{k+1}^j h_ke_k\]
		<img src="box.jpg">
		<p>
		Since \(f\) is diffable \(\Leftrightarrow\) each \(f_i\) is diffable, we may
		suppose without loss of generaliality that \(f \) maps into \(\mathbb{R}\). 
		</p>
		<p>
		Note that each of these \(p_j\in C(a;|h|)\subseteq C(a,\epsilon)\). Also note that 
		\[\overbrace{f(a+h) - f(a)}^{\text{related to the deriv}} = f(p_n)-f(p_0) = \sum_{j=1}^n
		\overbrace{f(p_j)-f(p_{j-1})}^{\text{relates to the par deriv}}\]
		
		</p>
		<p>
		In a lot of proofs in \(257\) we want to define a one dimensional case.
		</p>
		<p>
		If \(h_j\neq 0\) define \(\phi_j:[0,h_j]\to \mathbb{R}\) as \(\phi_j(t) = f(p_{j-1}t e_j\)
		By assumption, \(D_jf\) is a continous map on \(A\). Hence \(\phi_j\) is differentibale. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Since this is what we've done be fore we can invoke the Mean Value Theorem that we've used before 
		such that \(\phi_j(h_j)-\phi_j(c_j)h_j\Rightarrow f(p_j)-f(p_{j-1}) = D_jf(p_{j-1}+C_je_j)h_j\)
		</p>
		<p>
		If \(h_j=0\) then \(f(p_j)-f(p_{j-1})=0=D_jf(a)h_j\)
		therefore \(\exists q_j\in \overline{C(a,|h|) }\) such that 
		\(f(p_j)-f(p_{}j-1) = D_jf(q_j)h_j\)
		</p>
		<p>
		Therefore \(f(a+h)-f(a) = \sum_{j=1}^n D_jf(q_i)h_j\). Let \(B= [D_1f(a), D_2f(a) \cdots D_nf(a)]
		\). Thne we can write the following:
		</p>
		\[\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a) -Bh}{|h|} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n D_jf(q_i)h_j-\sum_{j=1}^nB_{ij}h_j}{|h|}\]
		<p>
		Since each of the \(q_i\) is in the rectangular prisim and it will approach \(q_j\to a\) when we collapse this cube it will reach the limit so \(B=Df(a)\).

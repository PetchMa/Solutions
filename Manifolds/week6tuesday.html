Inverse Function Theorem
	</h1>
	</div>
	<p>
	Observe that if \(a\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is a subspaces and that 
	\(f: A \to \mathbb{R}^n\) such that there exists \(U \subseteq A\) open with 
	the restriction \(F|_U \) is injective, then \(f|_U: U \to f(U)\) is bijective. 
	If \(g = {f|_U}^{-1}: f(U) = \to U\) is differentiable then \(D(g\circ f) = D\iota = I\)
	Also, \(D(g\circ f) (a) = Dg(f(a))Df(a)\). 
	</p>
	<P>
	Thus we have that \(Dg(f(a)) = (Df(a))^{-1}\). 
	</P>
	<p>
	The compairison in the one dimension case. The derivative of the inverse is the 1 over the 
	scalar. In this case we have the inverse matrix!
	</p>
	<p>
	The inverse function theorem doesnt force us to use the set \(U\) and doesnt force the inverse is differentiable. 
	</p>
	<h4>
		Inverse function theorem Definition:
	</h4>
	<p>
	We have the same set up as the thing above. Won't repeat it. We assume the function is of class 
	\(C^r\) we assume that we're given some point \(a\in A\) in such that \(Df(a)\) is invertible. 
	</p>
	<p>
	This implies that there \(\exists U \subseteq A\) open containing \(a\) such that \(f|_U\) is injective, and \(f(U)\) is open, \(g=f^{-1}|_U:f(U) \to U\) is differentiable and of class \(C^r\). 
	</p>
	<p>
	We just need to check that the matrix is in fact invertible. 
	</p>

	<h4>
		Proof
	</h4>
	<p>	
	<b>
		Technical Lemma:
	</b>
	Let \(A \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) be an open subspace  \(f: A \to \mathbb{R}n\) of class 
	\(C^1\) and an \(a\in A \) is such that \(Df(a)\) is invertible then \(\exists \alpha, \epsilon>0\) such that 
	\(\forall x_0, x\in C(\alpha;\epsilon)\), \(|f(x_0)-f(x_1)| \geq \alpha |x_0-x_1|\) in particual, 
	\(f|_{C(\alpha;\epsilon)}\). 
	</p>
	<p>
	It turns out there doesn't exist differentiable function if the domain and codomain 
	with a differentiable inverse. This mostly lies in there doesnt exists a continous inverse function with different dimensions. Thus we don't need to worry about that case! 
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>
		Steps to prove the inverse function theorem:
	</b>

	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Show existence of \(U\) such that the function restricted to it is injective and \(Df(x)\)
			is invertible 
			\(\forall x\in U\)
		</li>
		<li>
			Show that \(f(u)\) is open 
		</li>
		<li>
			Show that \(g = {f|_u}^{-1}: f(u)\to u\) is continous	
		</li>
		<li>
			Show that it is differentiable
		</li>
		<li>
			Show \(g\) is of class \(C^r\)
		</li>


	</ol>
	<p>
	The first lemma follows from the lemma that I've ommited the proof too. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Let \(y_0\in f(u)\) and \(x_0=g(y_0)\in U\) since \(U\) is open then 
	\(\exists \epsilon > 0 \) such that \(U(x_0;2\epsilon) \leq u\). Define 
	\(B= \{ x\in U:d(x_0,x) = \epsilon\}\). Then \(B\) is closed and bounded and hence compact. 
	Thus \(f(B)\) is compact and so \(\mathbb{R}^n \\ f(B)\) is open since \(x_0 \not \in B\)
	and injectivity \(\Rightarrow y_0 = f(x_0) \in \mathbb{R}^n\\ f(B)\). 
	</p>
	<p>
	Hence there exists a open set thats in the compliment. \(U(y_0: 2\delta) \subset \mathbb{R}^n \\ f(B)\)

	</p>
	<P>
	To show \(g\) continous suffices tho show the inverse is open lmao
	</P>
	<p>
	In step 4, Saied said go crazy with triangle inequality. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Last step: note that \(Dg(f(a)) = (D(f(a)))^{-1}\) then \(Dg(b) = (Df(g(b)))^{-1}\) where 
	\(b=f(a)\).

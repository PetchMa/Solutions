Polynomials

<h3>
Problem 1
</h3>
<p><b>Prove: </b>that \(f(x)=\sin x\) is not a polynomial.</p>
<p><b>Proof By Contradiction.</b></p>
<p>Assume that \(f(x)=\sin x\) is not a polynomial. If \(f(x)\) is a polynomial, then we can write the function as the product of \((x-a_i)\) factors, where \(a_i\) is a root
of the function \(f(x)\)
</p>
<p>We know the roots for the function \(f(x)\) is </p>
\[\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, \sin(a\pi) = 0\]
<p>We know then the factors should be... </p>
\[(x-\pi), (x-2\pi), (x-3\pi) ...\]
<p>Thus based on the theroem 3 all polynimals could be written as a product of its factors as such. Lets temporary call this function, \(g(x)\).</p>
\[g(x) = \prod_{i=-\infty}^\infty (x-i\pi)\]
<p>If \(f(x)\) were the same function as \(g(x)\) then \(sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) \) would be a polynomial based on its definition.</p>
<p>We check the value \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for \(f(x)\)</p>
\[f(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2})= 1\]
<p>We check the value \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for \(g(x)\)</p>
\[g(\frac{\pi}{2}) =  \prod_{i=-\infty}^\infty (\frac{\pi}{2}-i\pi)\]
<p><b>Notice: </b>that \(|\frac{\pi}{2}-i\pi| > 1, \forall i \in \mathbb{Z}\). 
We know that the product of values greater than 1, will also always be greater than 1. Thus we prove that...
</p>
\[g(\frac{\pi}{2}) \neq 1\]
<p>Thus clearly...</p>
\[f(\frac{\pi}{2}) \neq g(\frac{\pi}{2}) \]
<p>Since \(f(x)\) cannot be written as the product of its "factors" 
we can conclude that \(f(x)\) is not a polynimal since it contradicts the definition of a polynomial. 
</p>

<h3>
Problem 2
</h3>
<p><b>Prove: </b>that if two cubic polynomials intersect at 4 or more points, then those polyno-
mials are equal.</p>
<p>Let \(f(x) = a_0x^3+a_1x^2+a_2x+a_3\)</p>
<p>Let \(g(x) = b_0x^3+b_1x^2+b_2x+b_3\)</p>
<p>To find the intersection of \(f(x), g(x)\) then we solve for values in which \(f(x) =  g(x)\)
    which is when \(f(x)- g(x) = 0\). Let the function \(p(x) = f(x)- g(x) \). The intersections of 
    \(f, g\) are thus the roots of \(p(x)\).  
</p>
\[p(x) = f(x)- g(x) \]
\[p(x) = ( a_0x^3+a_1x^2+a_2x+a_3)- (b_0x^3+b_1x^2+b_2x+b_3) \]
\[p(x) = ( a_0-b_0)x^3+(a_1-b_1)x^2+(a_2-b_2)x+(a_3-b_3) \]
<p>We know that \(p(x)\) is a degree 3 polynomial. From the fundamental theorem of algebra 
    a degree 3 polynomial has at most 3 roots. 
</p>
<p>The only case where p(x) to have more than 3 roots, would be if the constants where all 0's thus \(p(x)\) would have an infinte number of 0's.

</p>
<p>
    If the constants were all zeros it would suggest that \(f(x) = g(x), \forall x \in \mathbb{R}\)
    thus we've proven that if two cubic polynomials intersect at 4 or more points, then those polyno-
    mials are equal.

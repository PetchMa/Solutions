      Arbitrary Intersection Proof
   </h2>
   <P>Prove the following. </P>
   \[\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} (\frac{-1}{k}, \frac{1}{k})=\{0\}\]
   <p>Make this easier we can draw a picture. </p>
   <div style="text-align: center;">

    <p><b>Direct Proof: </b></p>
    
 
   <p>Firstly we know that \(\forall k \in \mathbb{N}, \quad k>0\ \Rightarrow \{\frac{-1}{k} < 0 ,  \frac{1}{k} >0 \}\). Thus the element \({0}\) is always contained 
in the interval defined by \(\forall k \in \mathbb{N}, (\frac{-1}{k}, \frac{1}{k})\). We don't need to worry about \(0\) now.</p>

<p>Secondly, let \(x\) be some positive real number. We know from theorem of reciprocals we can always fit some number \(\frac{1}{n}\) in between the interval 
    \(0 < \frac{1}{n} < x\). We can say the same about negatives \(0 > \frac{1}{n} > -x\). If we said that \(k\geq |n|\) then \(x	\notin (\frac{-1}{k}, \frac{1}{k})\)
    since \(\frac{1}{k} < x\) and \(\frac{-1}{k} > -x\) which always excludes \(x\) from the set. 
</p>
<P>Thus its shown that you can always construct a \(k\) such that it will eventually exclude out every number between \((-1,1)\) except for \(0\). Thus the intersection is \(\{0\}\)</P>

<h2>
    Second Arbitrary Intersection Proof
 </h2>
 <P>Prove the following. </P>
 \[\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} (0, \frac{1}{k})=\{\varnothing \}\]
 <p><b>Direct Proof: [same method as before.]</b></p>
 <p>
     We let \(\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} (0, \frac{1}{k})= S\). Let \(x\) be some real number.
</p>
<p>We know that if \(x \leq 0, x	\notin S\) since the interval for the sets are defined to be greater than 0. Thus \(x > 0\). </p>
<p>We also know for \(x\) we can have a number \(\frac{1}{n}\) such that \(0< \frac{1}{n} < x, x\neq 0\). We can always "squish" another value in between 
the bounds. Lets define \(k\geq n\) on the interval \((0, \frac{1}{k})	\). Notice that \(x	\notin (0, \frac{1}{k})\) since \(\frac{1}{k} \leq \frac{1}{n} < x \Rightarrow \frac{1}{k} < x \). Thus \(x\) is out of the bounds. 
</p>
<p>Since we can always construct an interval  \((0, \frac{1}{k})\) such that it excludes \(x\) we can conclude that it will continue to exclude all the values found in the first set \((0,1)\).
    Thus the intersection is the \(\{\varnothing \}\) </p>

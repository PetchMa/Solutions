    <h2>
        Formal Logic 
    </h2>
    <p>Consider the following</p>
    \[\exists M \in \mathbb{R}, \quad N \in \mathbb{N}: \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x > N \Rightarrow f(x) \leq M\]
    <h3>
        Find a function that satisfy the following logic. 
    </h3>
    <p>We can translate this logic into English which says: <i>There exists, \(M\) (real) and \(N\) (natural) in which for all 
        real x values that are less then \(N\) the function never surpasses the value \(M\). 
    </i> What we're describing here is the following graphically.  </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="intervals.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>Any function that fits under that interval constraint would satisfy the logic. Infact \(f(x) = -x\) would simply do. In this case we can pick \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)</p>
    <h3>
        Prove that it satisfies the following logic. 
    </h3>
    <p>The logic says there <b>Exists </b> a case where this is true. Thus to prove its existence we just need to show a case where this function satisfies the logic.
    Produce a \(M \) and \(N\).</p>
    <p>Let \(M = 1\), \(N = 2\). \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\)</p>
    <p>We know that for the case \(N =2, f(2) = \frac{1}{2}\) which satisfies \(f(N) \leq M\)</p>
    <p>We can prove that the function  \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) is always decreasing along the interval \(x > N\) with the following proof.</p>
    <p>\(\forall k \in \mathbb{R}, k>0, (\frac{1}{x+k}-\frac{1}{x}) < 0 , \Rightarrow f(x)\) is decreasing. </p>
    \[\frac{1}{x+k}-\frac{1}{x} = \frac{x - (x+k)}{x(x+k)} \]
    \[\frac{1}{x+k}-\frac{1}{x} = \frac{-k}{x(x+k)} \]
    <p>We know that \(x > N \) which \(x > 2\) is always positive. We know that \( k>0\) thus it is evident that \(\frac{1}{x+k}-\frac{1}{x} < 0\) which implies that the function is always decreasing. 
    along this interval. </p>
    <p>
        Since the function is decreasing along this interval the maximal value it can take would be the smallest value \(x\) can take on. Which we know is \(< M\). Since there is no value that can surpass 
        this maximal value (as the function is always decreasing) we can conclude that the condition \(f(x) \leq M\) is thus satisfied. 

    </p>
    <p>\(\therefore \) We've proven the existence of such values \(M \) and \(N\) that satisfy the conditions. Thus \(f(x)\) satisfies the logic. </p>
    <h3>
        What is the negation of the statement?
    </h3>
    <p>We move in as we negate each statement.</p>
    \[\neg(\exists M \in \mathbb{R}, \quad N \in \mathbb{N}: \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x > N \Rightarrow f(x) \leq M)\]
    \[= \forall M \in \mathbb{R}, \quad N \in \mathbb{N} \neg( \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x > N \Rightarrow f(x) \leq M)\]
    \[= \forall M \in \mathbb{R}, \quad N \in \mathbb{N}: \exists x \in \mathbb{R}, (x > N) \wedge (f(x) > M)\]
    <p>In English this means: <i>There exists a real number \(x\) such that its \(> \) any natural number \(N\) and \(f(x) > \) any real number \(M\)</i></p>
    <h3>
        What is a function that satisfy the negation statement?
    </h3>
    <p>We know that it needs to be bigger than any value \(M\) correct? How do we make sure the function is greater than \(M\)? We add a positive number to it. 
        Thus our function could look like \(f(x) = |x| + M\). We know that \(N\in \mathbb{N}\) so \(x\) is always positive. \(f(x) = x + M\)
    </p>
    <h3>
        Prove it.
    </h3>
    <p><b>Proof by contradiction.</b> </p>
    <p>Assume that \(f(x) \leq M\) when \(x > N\). </p>
    <p>If the above were true then, \(f(x) - M \leq 0 \) when \(x > N\)</p>
    \[f(x) - M = (x+m) - M\]
    \[f(x) - M = x\]
    <p>For \(f(x) - M \leq 0 \Rightarrow x < 0 \). <B>Contradiction: </B> since we defined \(x > N\) where \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) 
    by definition, \(N > 0 \Rightarrow x > 0\). Thus it is impossible for \(f(x) \leq M\) when \(x > N\).</p>
    <h2>
        Negation Practice.
    </h2>
    <p> Negate the following examples. </p>
    <h4>
        1- The cow says moo
    </h4>
    <p>Simple we just flip it: "The cow doesn't say moo"</p>
    <h4>
        2- Every cow wears a fancy bell
    </h4>
    <p>We need to contradict this by saying: "there exists a cow that doesn't wear a fancy bell"</p>
    <h4>
        3- There is a barn in which every cow is very rectangular
    </h4>
    <p>Simple:  "There is a barn in which theres a cow that isn't very rectangular"</p>
    <h4>
        4- For any cow, there is an older cow.
    </h4>
    <p>We negate the "for any statement" by saying "there exists a cow there is no older cow"</p>
    <h4>
        5- Every odd numbered cow is female.
    </h4>
    <p>We negat the "for any statement" by saying "there exists an odd numbered cow thats male"</p>
<p>Remember that \(\neg(\forall \{condition\}) = \exists \neg\{condition\}\)</p>

<h3>Converse:</h3>
<P>The converse of the statement \(A ⇒ B\) is the statement \(B ⇒ A\)</P>
<h3>Contrapositive:</h3>
<P>The contrapositive of the statement \(A ⇒ B\) is the statement \(\neg B ⇒ \neg A\). We flip and negative. </P>
<h3>Implies argument: \(A \Rightarrow B\)</h3>
<p>If our hypothesis is TRUE AND the conclusion is TRUE. We should get TRUE. </p>
<p>If our hypothesis is TRUE AND the conclusion is FALSE. We should get False. </p>
<p>If our hypothesis is FALSE AND the conclusion is TRUE. We can't say its actually false because our assumption was already false. 
    Thus we say this is technically true because its not exactly wrong... </p>

   <h2>
       Rational Numbers Proof
   </h2>
   <p>Prove the following that \(\sqrt{3}\) is not rational.</p>
   <p><b>Proof By Contradiction. </b></p>
   <p>If \(\sqrt{3}\) is rational then we can rewrite \(\sqrt{3}\) in fractional form in lowest form such that \(\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}\) such that \(p\) and \(q\) are prime. Now
       lets try rearranging the equation. 
   </p>
   \[\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}\]
   \[q\sqrt{3} = p\]
   \[3q^2 = p^2\]
   <p>From this equation it would appear that \(p^2\) is divisible by 3. And thus \(3|p^2\) But since we know that \(p\) is relatively prime to \(q\) we know that \(3|p\) as well.
    </p>
    <p>We might as well rewrite \(p = 3n\) we can rewrite the equation again.</p>
    \[q\sqrt{3} = 3n\]
    \[3q^2 = 9n^2\]
    \[q^2 = 3n^2\]
    <p>From this equation it would appear that \(q^2\) is divisible by 3. And thus \(3|q^2\) But since we know that \(q\) is relatively prime to \(p\) we know that \(3|q\) as well.
    <i>Both \(p\) and \(q\) have the same factor. </i>
    </p>
    <p><B>Contradiction: </B> we assumed that \(p,q\) are relatively prime meaning they had no common factors. But clearly we've shown that its not possible to write 
    the value of \(\sqrt{3}\) in lowest fractional form. Thus \(\sqrt{3}\) is not rational.</p>
    <h2>
        Infimum & Supremum Proof
    </h2>   
    \[S = \{\frac{ n−1}{n}| n ∈ \mathbb{N} \} ⊆ \mathbb{Q}.\]
    <p><b>Infimum</b></p>
    <p>We can test for the greatest lower bound by taking the limit of set  \(S\). We know the lower bound of natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\) is 1. We also know that the derivative of the function defined by
      \(f(n) =  \frac{ n−1}{n}\) is the following.  
    </p>
    \[f'(n) = \frac{d}{dn}\frac{ n−1}{n} = \frac{1}{n^2} \]
    <p>Since the function \(f(n)\) that creates the set \(S\) is always increasing, on the open set \(n ∈ \mathbb{N}\), we know then that the least value of the set \(S\) is also the smallest
        value of \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Thus we test the extreme value here.  
    </p>
    \[\lim_{n \rightarrow 1} \frac{ n−1}{n} = 0\]
    <p>There is a greatest lower bound because the set \(S\) contains a global minimum which is a \(\subseteq \mathbb{Q}\). </p>
    <p><b>Supremum</b></p>
    <p>We know that the set of all natural numbers has no greatest value. We know that the elements of set \(S\) is mapped by the function \(f(n) =  \frac{ n−1}{n}\) is always increase along the same interval.
        This suggests that the set \(S\) can always take on a larger and larger element. This contradicts the definition of a Supremum and thus there is no least upper bound.   </p>
        <p>We know that </p>
        \[\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{ n−1}{n} = 1\]
        <p>But we also know that\( \frac{ n−1}{n} \neq 1\) as it can approach but never equal. Thus there can always be a number between  \(1\) and the maximal element in which it will supercede the maximal element of the set \(S\)</p>
        
    <p>There is no least upper bound because the set of all natural numbers has no maximum. This suggests that the set \(S\) can always have an infinitly larger 
        maximal element since the function \(f(n) =  \frac{ n−1}{n}\) is always increase along the same interval. </p>
    <h2>
        Infimum & Supremum Problem 2
    </h2>
    \[Let \quad S = \{x ∈ \mathbb{Q} | x < \sqrt{2}\}\]
    <h3>
        a) Show that S is not bounded above in \(S\)
    </h3>
    <p>
        We need to show that there cannot exist a maximal element. Which is that \(x_1 \in S\) and there always exists an \(x_2 \in S\) where \(x_2 > x_1\).
    </p>
    <p>We know that \(x_1 \in S\) that  \(x_1 > \sqrt{2}\) because the set \(S \in \mathbb{Q}\) and \(\sqrt{2}\) is not a rational number. 
        But by the density of rational number says you can always "squeeze" in a rational number between two real numbers. More rigourously said as \(a,b\in \mathbb{R}\) there \(\exists c \in \mathbb{Q}\) where 
        \(a< c < b \). Thus we know the following \(x_1<\sqrt{2}\) we also know \(\exists x_2 \in \mathbb{Q}\) such that \(x_1< x_2<\sqrt{2}\). Thus we've proved that there can always be a value greater than its maximal element.
    </p>
    <h3>
        b) show that S is bounded above in \( \mathbb{Q} \)
    </h3>
    <p>We need to show that there exists a rational number thats greater than the maximal element in the set to show it is bounded in the above limit.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Contradiction: </b>We know that the set \(S\) is bounded by \(x < \sqrt{2}\) and we know that any rational number such as \(24 \in \mathbb{Q}\). Since the number \(24 > \sqrt{2}\) 
        proves the existence of a number that's greater than the maximal element of set \(S\) which suggests that \(S\) is bounded by a greater set in \(\mathbb{Q}\) 
    </p>
    <h3>
        c) show that S is bounded above in \( \mathbb{R} \)
    </h3>
    <p>We do the same thing, we need to show that there exists a real number thats greater than the maximal element in the set to show it is bounded in the above limit.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Contradiction: </b>We know that the set \(S\) is bounded by \(x < \sqrt{2}\) and we know that any rational number such as \(3.15 \in \mathbb{R}\). Since the number \(3.15 > \sqrt{2}\) 
        proves the existence of a number that's greater than the maximal element of set \(S\) which suggests that \(S\) is bounded by a greater set in \(\mathbb{R}\) 
    </p>
    <h3>
        d) show that S does not have a supremum in \( \mathbb{Q} \)
    </h3>
    <p>We use the same technique in part A</p>
    <p>In order for there to be a supremum there must exist one value that is the least upper bound of the set \(S\). Let \(x \in \mathbb{S}\) be the maximal element in 
        the set. We know by the definition that \(x < \sqrt{2}\). We know from density of rationals that for every real number (a,b\in \mathbb{R}\) there \(\exists c \in \mathbb{Q}\) where 
        \(a< c < b \). This suggests that \(x< c < \sqrt{2}\). Since \(c \in \mathbb{Q}, c<\sqrt{2}, \quad c\in \mathbb{s}\). We previously set \(x\) as the maximal element but we've clearly shown there can always exists 
        some \(c\) in which it fits within the set \(S\) thats also greater than the maximal element contradicting the existence of a supremum.

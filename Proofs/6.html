      Functions
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Problem 1
 </h3>
 <p><b>Prove: that the composition of two decreasing functions is increasing.</b></p>
 <p>Let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) and \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)\). This means that for every \(y\) greater than \(x\) the function value \(f(y)\)is less
     than \(f(x)\). Thus \(f(x)\) is decreasing. 
 </p>
 <p>Let \(g: Y \rightarrow Z\) and \(y_1 \leq y_2 \Rightarrow g(y_1) \geq g(y_2)\). 
</p>
<p>We define the composite function as \(g(f(x))\).
</p>
<p>
    We know that by definition that \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)\). We know that then the relationship 
    \(f(x_2) \leq f(x_1) \Rightarrow  g(f(x_2)) \geq g(f(x_1))\) by definition of a decreasing function. 
</p>
<p>Since we definied that \(x_1 \leq x_2 \) we know then that \( g(f(x_1)) \leq g(f(x_2)) \) which is the definition of an increasing function.</p>
<h3>
    Problem 2
 </h3>
 <p><b>Prove: the composition of a decreasing function with an increasing function is decreasing (regardless
    of order)</b></p>
    <p>Let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) and \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)\). This means that for every \(y\) greater than \(x\) the function value \(f(y)\)is greater
        than \(f(x)\). Thus \(f(x)\) is increasing. 
    </p>
    <p>Let \(g: Y \rightarrow Z\) and \(y_1 \leq y_2 \Rightarrow g(y_1) \geq g(y_2)\). Decreasing function. 
   </p>
   <p>We define the composite function as \(g(f(x))\).
   </p>
   <p>By definition, \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)\) and thus by the second definition \(f(x_1) \leq f(x_2) \Rightarrow g(f(x_1)) \geq g(f(x_2))\)
       Thus we shown that \(x_1 \leq x_2  \Rightarrow g(f(x_1)) \geq g(f(x_2))\) which means its a decreasing function. 
   </p>
   <p>Similarly if we were to flip the order... </p>
   <p>By definition, \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow g(x_1) \geq g(x_2)\) and thus by the second definition \(g(x_2) \geq g(x_1) \Rightarrow f(g(x_2)) \leq f(g(x_1))\)
    Thus we shown that \(x_1 \leq x_2  \Rightarrow g(f(x_1)) \geq g (f(x_2))\) which means its a decreasing function. 
</p>
<h3>
    Problem 3
 </h3>
 <p><b>Prove: the composition of an increasing function with a strictly increasing function is increasing
    (regardless of order)</b></p>

    <p>Let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) and \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)\)). This means that for every \(x_2\) greater than \(x_1\) the function value \(f(x_2)\)is greater
        than \(f(x_1)\). Thus \(f\) is increasing. 
    </p>
    <p>Let \(g: Y \rightarrow Z\) and \(y_1 \leq y_2 \Rightarrow g(y_1) \leq g(y_2)\). 
   </p>
   <p>We define the composite function as \(g(f(x))\).
   </p>
   <p>
       We know that by definition that \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)\). We know that then the relationship 
       \(f(x_1) \leq f(x_2) \Rightarrow  g(f(x_1)) \leq g(f(x_2))\) by definition of a increasing function. 
   </p>
   <p>Since we definied that \(x_1 \leq x_2 \) we know then that \( g(f(x_1)) \leq g(f(x_2)) \) which is the definition of an increasing function.</p>
   <h3>
    Problem 4
 </h3>
 <p><b>Prove: Prove that if \(f\) is both increasing and decreasing then \(f\) is a constant function.</b></p>
<p>Define \(f\) as decreasing first. </p>
<p>Let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) and \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)\). 
</p>
<p>Define \(f\) as increasing. </p>
<p>Let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) and \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)\). </p>
<p>The only case where \(f(x_1) \geq f(x_2)\) and \(f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)\) to be both satisfied is when \(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\)</p>
<p>Thus we define \(f\) as \(x_1 \leq x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) = f(x_2)\) which is the definition of a constant function. </p>
<h3>
    Problem 5
 </h3>
 <p><b>Prove that \(f : \mathbb{R} → \mathbb{R}, f(x) = -x\) is strictly decreasing</b></p>
 <p>If \(x_1 < x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) > f(x_2)\) then \(f\) is strictly decreasing </p>
 <p>Assuming that \(x_1 < x_2\) we know that \(f(x_1) = -x_1\) and \(f(x_2) = -x_2\). </p>
 <p>We know then based on the assumption that  \(x_1 < x_2\) then \(-x_1 > -x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) > f(x_2) \)</p>
 <p>Thus \(x_1 < x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) > f(x_2)\) which means its strictly decreasing. </p>
 <h3>
    Problem 6 
 </h3>
 <p>
    For each of the following functions check to see if it is injective or surjective. If it is
    both, compute the inverse (be sure to specify the domain and codomain of the inverse):
 </p>
 <p><b>Injective:</b></p>
 <p>This is equivalent to saying that any horizontal line intersects the graph of f at most once.</p>
 <p>Defined that \(f(x) =f(y) \Rightarrow x = y\)</p>
 <p><b>Surjective:</b></p>
 <p>This is equivalent to saying that any horizontal line intersects the graph of f at least once.</p>
 <p>Defined that \(∀y ∈ Y, ∃x ∈ X : f(x) = Y\)</p>
 <p><b>Bijective:</b></p>
 <p>Bijective if and only if it is both injective and surjective.This is equivalent to saying that any horizontal line intersects the graph of f exactly once.</p>
 <h4>
     \(f : \mathbb{R} → \mathbb{R}, f(x) = 2x + 1\)
 </h4>
 <p>Injective: True</p>
 <p>Defined that \(f(x) =f(y) \Rightarrow x = y\)</p>
 \[f(x_1) = 2x_1+1, \quad f(x_2) = 2x_2+1, \quad f(x_1)=f(x_2) \Rightarrow 2x_1+1 = 2x_2+1 \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2\]
 <p>Surjective: True </p>
 <p>If \(y \in \mathbb{R} \quad f(\frac{y-1}{2}) = y\) This is true for any value of \(y\) and thus it meets the criteria that any horizontal line intersects the graph at least once. </p>
 <p>Bijective: True</p>
 <p>Inverse is \( f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y-1}{2}\) </p>
<h4>
    \(f : [0, 1] → [1, 5], f(x) = 2x + 1\)
</h4>
<p>Injective: True</p>
\[f(x_1) = 2x_1+1, \quad f(x_2) = 2x_2+1, \quad f(x_1)=f(x_2) \Rightarrow 2x_1+1 = 2x_2+1 \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2\]
 <p>Surjective: Fails</p>
<P>The value \(y=5\) has no solution since not enough values of\(x\) are mapped. Thus any horizontal line DOES NOT intersects the graph of f at least once. </P>
 <p>Bijective: Fails</p>
 <p>It is not Surjective.</p>

<h4>
    \(f : \mathbb{R} → \mathbb{R}, f(x) = x^4\)
</h4>
<p>Injective: False</p>
<p>Any horizontal line intersects the graph of \(f\) MORE than once. Thus failing</p>
\[f(-x) = (-x)^4 = x^4 = f(x)\]
 <p>Surjective: True.</p>
 <p>If \(y \in \mathbb{R} \quad f(\sqrt[4]{y}) = y\) This is true for any value of \(y\) and thus it meets the criteria that any horizontal line intersects the graph at least once. </p>
 <p>Bijective</p>
 <p>Not injective.</p>
<h4>
    \(f : (−\infty, 0] → [0, \infty), f(x) = x^4\)
</h4>
<p>Injective: True</p>
<p>For every value \(x\) there is at most 1 value in \(f(x)\)</p>
\[f(x_1) = x_1^4, \quad f(x_2) = x_2^4, \quad f(x_1)=f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1^4 = x_2^4 \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2\]
 <p>Surjective: True</p>
 <p>If \(y \in [0, \infty) \quad f(\sqrt[4]{y}) = y\) This is true for any value of \(y\) and thus it meets the criteria that any horizontal line intersects the graph at least once. </p>
 <p>Bijective: True</p>
 <p>True since its both injective and surjective.</p>
 \[y \in[0, \infty) \quad f^{-1}(y) = -\sqrt[4]{y}\]

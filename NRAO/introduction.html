        Introduction Notes Radio Astronomy.  
        </h1>

    <p><b>Radio Astronomy is the study of radio radiation from celestial sources.</b> The denotation \(v\) is meant to represent frequency
     and the symbol for \(\lambda\) represents the wavelength. The conversion between the two is \(v= \frac{c}{\lambda}\) where \(c\) represents 
    the speed of light. Example, 10MHz => \(\lambda = \frac{3\times 10^8}{10\times 10^6} = 30m\).</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Why Radio Astronomy?</h3>
    <p>Because it gets past our atmosphere and most clouds in the the celestial sky and on Earth. Infrared, UV, X-ray and Gamma rays are absorbed by the atmosphere.
        There are two atmospheric windows. => Visible Light. And Radio wave lengths. Everything is absorbed so this makes sense. Sinkhole. 
    </p>
    <p>Also radio astronomy lets us preform observations in the day. This is because, the sun produces a lot less "distraction" in radio wave lengths. It is negligble and thus
        unlike optical astronomy we can see during the day and the dark!

    <h3>Whats causing this absorbtion?</h3>
    <p>So at <b>higher frequency</b> we just blocked by vibrational transitions of atmospheric molecules such as \(CO_2\), \(O_2\), and \(H_2O\).
    This is because they have energies comparable wtih those of mid-infrared photons. So vibrating molecules absorb it all.</p>
    <p>At lowere frequency things are blocked due to variable ionospheric refraction. Radio waves having frequencies 10 MHz (wavelengths 30 m) 
        are usually reflected back into space by the Earth's ionosphere</p>

    <p>Radio isn't perfect either. Things like water vapor and clouds block visibility of the radio frequency. For example, emission by water vapor in the warm and humid atmosphere above Green Bank, WV precludes sensitive observations near the water-vapor line at 22 GHz (1 GHz 109 Hz) during the summer. Green Bank can be quite cold and dry in the winter, 
        allowing observations at frequencies approaching 115 GHz </p>
    <h3>Radio Telescopes and Aperture Synthesis Interferometers</h3>
    <p>Radio telescopes kinda have poor resolution.... The reason why is angular resolution is determined by the wavelength divided by the diameter
        of the operating disk. \(\theta = \frac{\lambda}{D}\). In perspective, the supposed angular resolution is equal to that of the human eye, given the 
        largest single dish telescope. This resolution is called the primary beam. Ariecibo = 60 arcsec \(60 arcsec = \frac{6cm}{200}\)
    </p>
    <p>How can we improve this? We have the observational area larger! This can be done with an Interferometer that looks at multiple 
        dishes and compiles them together. Aperture-synthesis interferometry at radio wavelengths provides unparalleled sensitivity, fidelity, resolution, and position accuracy. 
        This is a huge practical advantage of radio astronomy.
    </p>
    <p>However... they can be a little tricky in getting a proper image of the night sky due to shifts in the reciver and delays in signals. This will be explained later on.</p>

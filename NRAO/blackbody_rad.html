       Blackbody Radiation 
        </h1>
    </div>
    <p>Blackbody radiation is computing the amount of emitted light based on the total absorbtion of electromagnetic radiation. There exists two major approaches to
        calculating this radiation. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law - which was wrong and The Planck Radiation Law that fixed what was wrong. Here is the derivation for both.

    <h3>The Rayleigh-Jeans Law</h3>
   Imagine a black box, with a wave that is resonating within it. The resonance wave length can be calculated in each x, y and z direction as the following. Where n is a whole number and represents
   the modes.
   \[{n_{\rm x} \lambda_{\rm x} \over 2} = {n_{\rm y} \lambda_{\rm y} \over 2}
    = {n_{\rm z} \lambda_{\rm z} \over 2} = a\]
   
    \[\lambda_{\rm y} = {\lambda \over \cos\,\beta}
   {\rm ~~~and~~~}
   \lambda_{\rm z} = {\lambda \over \cos\,\gamma} {\rm ~~~and~~~}\lambda_{\rm x} = {\lambda \over \cos\,\alpha}\]
   <p>If we were to rearrange the first equation for the wave lengths </p>
   \[n_{\rm x} = {2 a \over \lambda_{\rm x}},    n_{\rm y} = {2
    a \over \lambda_{\rm
    y}},    n_{\rm z} = {2 a \over \lambda_{\rm z}}\]
    <p>If we substitude the original in for \(\lambda_x\)... etc</p>
    \[n_{\rm x} = {2 a \cos\,\alpha \over \lambda},    n_{\rm y}
    = {2 a \cos\,\beta \over \lambda},    n
    _{\rm z} = {2 a \cos\,\gamma \over \lambda}\]
    <p>If we square and sum each of the modes, which represents the magnitude of the N in three space</p>
    \[n_{\rm x}^2 + n_{\rm y}^2 + n_{\rm z}^2 = \biggl({2 a \over
        \lambda}\biggr)^2 (\cos^2\,\alpha + \cos^2\,\beta + \cos^2\,\gamma)~.\]
    <p>The indentity gives us the following</p>
    \[n_{\rm x}^2 + n_{\rm y}^2 + n_{\rm z}^2 = \biggl({2 a \over
    \lambda}\biggr)^2 \]
    <p>We know this as the fundemental wave equation... we sub in for \(\lambda\) and solve for the frequency /p>
    \[v = {c \over \lambda}\]
    \[\nu = {c \over 2 a}\sqrt{n_{\rm x}^2 + n_{\rm y}^2 + n_{\rm z}^2}\]
    <p>Now given this xyz space containing the possible values of \((n_x,n_y,n_z)\). Each of these points represent a mode of equilibrium cavity radiation. 
        The space density of points in this lattice is unity, so the number of points in any volume is equal to that volume

    <p>Since this is a sphere we can calculate it as such: </p>
    \[\rho^2 = n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\]
    <p>We can simplify the frequency as the following. </p>
    \[\nu = {c \over \lambda} = {c \rho \over 2 a}\]
    <p>The inner surface area is the following. Its divided by 8 as its only an octant withinthe entire sphere. It is 1\8th of the entire sphere. But keep in mind, Thereexists two
        polarizations and thus we have double the amount. 
    </p>
    \[N(\nu) d\nu = {4 \pi \rho^2 d \rho \over 8} \times 2\]
    <p>We can sub in the value of \(\rho\)</p>
    \[\rho = {2 a \nu \over c}\]
    \[d\rho = {2 a d\nu \over c}\]
    \[N(\nu) d\nu = \pi \biggl({2 a \nu \over c}\biggr)^2 {2a \over c}
    d\nu\]
    <p>Now we define the spectral energy density with that equation. This is based off of equipartition of energy. Where \(\langle E \rangle = kT\) is the 
        average energy per mode. The total energy
    </p>
    \[u_t = {N(\nu) d\nu } kT\]
    <p>The density of the spectral energy is then ... </p>
    \[u_\nu(T) = {N(\nu) d\nu \over a^3 } kT\]
    <p>If we simplify with the subsitution </p>
    \[u_\nu(T) = {8 \pi a^3 \over a^3} {\nu^2 \over c^3} kT = 8 \pi k T
    {\nu^2 \over c^3}\]
    <p>The total energy density of the entire spectral is thus the following </p>
    \[\bbox[border:3px blue solid,7pt]{u_\nu = {1 \over c} \int I_\nu d
    \Omega}\]
    <p>If we were to assume a perfect black body then the following integral will be true since it is isotropic and also spherical. Note the integral works because anything inside contains 
        no terms in respect to \(\Omega\) </p>
    \[u_\nu = {1 \over c}\int_{4\pi} B_\nu d \Omega =  {4 \pi \over c}
    B_\nu\]
    <p>Thus we have ... </p>
    \[{4 \pi \over c} B_\nu = {8 \pi k T \nu^2 \over c^3}\]
    
    <h3>Max Planck fixed the problem. lol </h3>
    <p>Okay so if u realized, this doesn't work. The equation is quadratic in nature and thus approx fucking infinity when it approaches smaller wave lengths 
        or higher frequency. However, that makes it impossible to conserve energy at that point giving it infinity energy which wasn't the result of experimental 
        tests.

    <p>The solution was to quantize the energy into discrete partitions. Energy existed as a individual packet of energy and not infact continous. We are given the Planck Constant.</p>
    \[E
    = n h \nu, \qquad n = 1,~2,~3,~...\]
    <p>We were given this probability distribution by boltzmann saying that </p>
    \[P(E) \propto
    \exp\biggl({-E \over k T}\biggr)\]
    <p>Subbing in our new found form of energy we get </p>
    \[P(E) = P(n h \nu) \propto
    \exp\biggl({ - n h \nu \over k T}\biggr)\]
    <p>the average energy per mode is calculated by summing over only the discrete energies permitted instead of integrating over all energies</p>
    \[\langle E \rangle =
    {\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n h \nu P(n h \nu) \over \sum_{n = 0}^\infty P(n h
    \nu)} =
    {\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n h \nu \exp\bigl({ - n h \nu \over k T}\bigr)
    \over
    \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp\bigl({ - n h \nu \over k T}\bigr)}\]
    <p>To solve the following we can do this. let \({1 \over k T} = a\)</p>
    \[\langle E \rangle =
    {\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n h \nu \exp\bigl({ -a n h \nu}\bigr)
    \over
    \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp\bigl({ -a n h \nu}\bigr)}\]
    <p>Now to help simplify, take the ln and the derivative in respect to a of the following.</p>
   
    \[- {d \over d\alpha}\biggl[\ln \sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)\biggr]\]
    <p>Eval the derivative with chain rule</p>
    \[- {d \over d\alpha}\biggl[\ln \sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)\biggr] = {1 \over \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp(-
    \alpha n h \nu)}
    {-d \over d \alpha} \biggl[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty  \exp(-\alpha n h
    \nu)\biggr]\]
    
    \[- {d \over d\alpha}\biggl[\ln \sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)\biggr] = {1 \over \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp(-
    \alpha n h \nu)}
     \biggl[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty  {-d \over d \alpha}\exp(-\alpha n h
    \nu)\biggr]\]
    \[- {d \over d\alpha}\biggl[\ln \sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)\biggr] = {1 \over \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp(-
    \alpha n h \nu)}
     \biggl[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \alpha n h \exp(-\alpha n h
    \nu)\biggr]\]

    \[- {d \over d\alpha}\biggl[\ln \sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)\biggr] = {\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n h \nu \exp (-
    \alpha n h \nu) \over \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp(- \alpha n h
    \nu)}\]
    <p>Now all we need to evaluate is the following: </p>
    \[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu) = 1 + [\exp( - \alpha h \nu)]^1 +
    [\exp( - \alpha h \nu)]^2 + \dots ~.\]
    <p>We notice its like a geometric series. </p>
    \[\sum^{\infty} ax^n = \frac{a}{1-x}\]
    <p>Therefore the following is true.</p>
    \[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty
    \exp(- \alpha n h \nu) = \frac{1}{1- \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)}\]
    <p>Now we can evaluate </p>
    \[- {d \over d\alpha}\biggl[\ln \frac{1}{1- \exp(- \alpha n h \nu)}] = {\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n h \nu \exp (-
    \alpha n h \nu) \over \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp(- \alpha n h
    \nu)}\]
    <p>If we evalulate the derivative we get the following: </p>
    \[\langle E \rangle = -[1 - \exp( - \alpha h \nu)] (-1)
    [1 - \exp( - \alpha h \nu)]^{-2} h \nu\exp (- \alpha h \nu)\]
    \[\langle E \rangle = {h \nu \over \exp\bigl({h \nu \over k T}\bigr)
    -1}\]
    <p>Thus if we were to place this as the distribution instead of the classical \(kT\) we get </p>
    \[\bbox[border:3px blue
    solid,7pt]{B_\nu = {2 h \nu^3 \over c^2}
    {1 \over \exp\bigl({h \nu \over k T}\bigr)
    -1}}\]
    <p>This solves all the problems because the integral over everything is not infinite anymore! </p>
    \[{B(T) \equiv \int_0^\infty B_\nu(T) d\nu = {\sigma
        T^4 \over \pi}}\]

            Larmor Radiation - Radiation from an Accelerated Charge
        </h1>
    </div>
    <p>This is the basics of electrodynamics. When charges move through electric fields and are accelerating.
        How do we find and describe this movement and interactions with physics? 
        It is said that all electromagnetic radiation is ultimately generated by accelerating electrical charges.

    </p>
    <p>Based on Coulomb's law, a stationary charge will have an electric field lines that are radial.
        Suppose a charged particle is accelerated to some small velocity v in some short time t. At time t later,  there will be a perpendicular component of electric field </p>

    <p>Thus we can arrive at the following equation based on the perpendicular electric field and the electric field. </p>
    \[{E_{\bot} \over
    E_{\rm r}} = {\Delta v \, t \, \sin\theta \over c \Delta t}~,\]
    <p>Coulombs law states the following. </p>
    \[{E_{\rm r} = { q \over
        r^2}}\]
    <p>We can solve then for the perpendicular electric field.</p>
    \[\frac{E_\bot r^2}{q}=\frac{\Delta v t \sin(\theta)}{c \Delta t}\]
    \[E_\bot=\frac{q\Delta v t \sin(\theta)}{r^2c \Delta t}\]
    <p>We know the following based on speed = distance x time</p>
    \[r = ct\]
    \[t = {r \over c}\]
    \[E_\bot=\frac{q\Delta v  \sin(\theta)}{rc^2 \Delta t}\]
    \[E_\bot=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\frac{q  \sin(\theta)}{rc^2 }\]
    <p>Note that it contains the acceleration of the particle within the equation.</p>
    \[{E_\bot = {q \dot{v} \sin\theta \over
    r c^2}}\]
    <p> This is the transverse field \(E_\bot\) and instantaneously reflects the applied acceleration.</p>
    <p>To calculate the flux or how much power is radiated in one direction, we look at the Poynting flux.
        Which states that the flux is the cross product between the electric field and the magnetic field lines. 

    </p>
    \[\vec{S} = {c \over 4 \pi} \vec{E}
    \times \vec{H}\]
    <p> However, we know that the magnitude of both fields are the same and thus. </p>
    \[{\vert \vec{S} \vert = {c \over 4
        \pi}E^2}\]
    <p>If we just subed the value of the transverse wave we get the following.</p>
    \[\vert \vec{S} \vert = {1 \over 4\pi} {q^2 \dot{v}^2 \over c^3}
    {\sin^2\theta \over r^2}\]
    <p>Now lets say we wish to find the  total power emitted? The previous gave us power
    emitted through one direction. Here we have the following. 
    </p>
    \[P = \int_{\rm sphere} \vert \vec{S} \vert dA\]
    <p>Spherical Coordinates </p>
    \[P = {q^2
        \dot{v}^2 \over 4 \pi c^3} \int_{\phi = 0}^{2\pi} \int_{\theta = 0}^\pi
        {\sin^2 \theta \over r^2} \, r\sin\theta d\theta \, r d\phi\]
        \[P =
        {q^2 \dot{v}^2 \over 2 c^3} \int_{\theta = 0}^\pi \sin^3\theta
        d\theta\]
        \[{P = {2 \over 3}{q^2 \dot{v}^2 \over
        c^3}}\]
        <p>This is Larmor's equation, and thus shows the total power output of a given by an electric field in 
            motion.

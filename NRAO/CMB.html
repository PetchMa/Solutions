            Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation - CMB

   <p>The universe is filled with blackbody radiation, this background and persisten radiation is the relict
       of the big bang. The peak brightness is around \(v_{rm max} = 160 GHz\)

  <p>The problem is that this entire background radiation is near isotropic and thus very hard to detect if isotropic 
      if it is coming from everywhere. It was accidentally discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson 
       at Bell Labs.  They reported careful measurements indicating an isotropic "excess antenna temperature" produced by their horn antenna at 4080 MHz.  
       Subsequent measurements, especially by the COBE 
       (COsmic Background Explorer) satellite, have demonstrated that this "excess noise" 
      matches a blackbody spectrum within 50 parts per million well into the far infared. 
  </p>
  <p>The universe is spatially homogenous and isotropic, so the properties of the CMB can be calculated 
      by considering what happens to blackbody radiation in a small cube whose side length a(t) slowly grows 
      with time t since the big bang. The first law of thermodynamics requires energy conservation as the total heat Q, 
      internal energy U, and work W done by the radiation in the cube change as the volume V=a3 of the cube grows by a small amount dV</p>
      \[dQ = dU + dW = dU + p dV\]
      <p>Radiation exerts pressure because photons of frequency  have momentum hc as well as energy h.he radiation pressure equals the rate of momentum transfer per unit area.  
          Blackbody radiation is isotropic so the radiation pressure p produced by photons of frequency  is</p>
          \[p_\nu = {2 \over c} \int B_\nu \cos^2 \theta d \Omega\]
          \[p = \int_0^\infty p_\nu d \nu = {2 \over c}
          \int_0^\infty
          B_\nu d\nu \int_0^{2 \pi} d \phi \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^2 \theta \sin
          \theta d\theta = {4 \pi B \over c} \int_0^1 x^2 dx\]
        <p>Substituting the radiation energy density u=4Bc and integrating relates the radiation pressure and energy density of 
            isotropic radiation:</p>
            \[p = {u
                \over
                3}\]
        <p>The second law of thermodynamics relates the change in entropy S to the change in heat Q and the temperature T:</p>
        \[dS
        =
        {dQ
        \over
        T}\]
        \[dS = {dU \over T} + p {dV \over T} = {d (uV) \over T} + {u
            \over 3} {dV \over T} = {u dV \over T} + {V du \over T} + {u
            dV \over 3 T}\]
        \[dS = {4 u \over 3 T}dV + {V \over T} {du \over dT}
        dT\]
        <p>Setting dS=0 for an adiabatic expansion and substituting \(u=4\sigma T^4c\) yields</p>
\[{dV \over V} = - 3{d T
    \over
    T}~.\]<p>Therefore, the temprature of the universe is inversely proportional to the size of the universe. The total number of photons 
        in the expanding cube is unchanged, but the wavelength  of each photon grows linearly with the scale size a(t).  
        Astronomers frequently use the term redshift defined by</p>
        \[z \equiv {\lambda_{\rm o}
        - \lambda_{\rm e} \over \lambda_{\rm e}}= {\lambda_{\rm o} \over
        \lambda_{\rm e}} -1\]
        <p>Thus the temperature of the CMB at any redshift z is</p>
        \[T = T_0 (1 + z)~, T\approx 2.725\]

            Radio Telescope Info 
        </h1>
    </div>
    <p> The radio band is too wide to have one telescope design that fits everything.
        Things like the surface brightness and angular sizes are so broad and diverse 
        that a combination of radio telescopes are needed to observe them.
    </p>
    <p>The idea radio telescope should have a collecting area to detect as faint of a source based on 
        \[\langle A_e \rangle = {\lambda^2 \over 4 \pi}\] and since \(\lambda\)
        is squared, the desired observational wavelength needs an effective area that grows significantly.
    </p>
    <p>The first radio telescope was built by Karl Jansky where \(\lambda = 15m\) 
        The wire antenna is an array of phased dipoles. It had a large collecting area as \(\lambda \) was
         so large. Directive aperture antennas are needed for adequate sensitivity at higher frequencies.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">

    </div>
    <p>Example of directive apertures are waveguide horns. 
        At the end of the horn is a waveguide with parallel walls, 
        and inside this waveguide is a quarter-wave ground-plane vertical antenna 
        that converts the electromagnetic wave into an electrical current that is 
        sent to the receiver via a cable.
    </p>
    <p>These don't pick up ground radiation because they dont have a feed structure that scatters ground radiation 
        into the reciever.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="horn.jpg" width ="300px">
    </div>
    <p>Thus small horn antennas have been used by radio astronomers to 
        measure the absolute flux densities of very strong sources such as Cas A</p>
   <p>Typically with dishes measure relative flux densities by comparing results relative to 
       known "candles" or to known densities with horn guides. 
   </p>
   <p>Most telescopes are paraboloidal reflectors to get larger collecting areas. 
    However, because the feed is on the reflector axis, the feed and legs
     supporting it blocks some of the path of radiation falling onto the reflector. 
     This causes 
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li>The effective collecting area is reduced due to blocked radiation.
        </li>
        <li>The beam pattern is bad since it has more sidelobe levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Radiation from the ground that is scattered off the feed and its 
            support structure increases the system noise.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus this forced people to build larger telescopes to avoid these problems like a blocked
        aperature. However telescopes that are \(f/D
        \approx 0.4\) become physically inpractical. 
    </p>
    <p>Basically all radio telescopes have an alt-az mounts turning on tacks horizontal and vertical. 
        Some have polar mounts like the green bank telescope. 
    </p>
    <h3>Sub Reflectors</h3>
    <p>Basically a reflector that reflects the primary beam again to double the path 
        allowing a higher \(f/D\) ratio without the engineering problems. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            optimize the tradeoff between high aperture efficiency and low sidelobes
        </li>
        <li>
            Recievers are  easier to access
        </li>
        <li>
            spillover radiation is directed toward the cold sky instead of 
            the warm ground, lowering overall system temperatures
        </li>
        <li>
            The subreflector can by moved rapidly to switch 
            the beam between two adjacent positions on the sky
        </li>
        <li>
            subreflector can be tilted to select one of several feeds at the secondary focus 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Draw backs are </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Standing waves in the leaky cavity formed by the reflector and subreflector
             cause sinusoidal ripples in the observed spectra of strong radio sources
        </li>
        <li>
            larger feeds are required to produce the narrow beams needed for the subreflector
        </li>
       
    </ul>
    <p>We have three types of secondary reflectors, Cassegrain, Gregorian and OffAxis feed.</p>
    <p>Cassegrain telescopes have a convex secondary reflector which follows a hyperboloid. 
        For a subreflector located below the prime focus, the required shape is a hyperboloid whose
         major axis coincides with the major axis of the paraboloid. 
    </p>
    <p>This design makes the small subreflector light, 
        easy to tilt, and reduces standing waves, but it subtends a small angle</p>
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="cassegrain.PNG" width ="500px">
        </div>  
    <p>Gregorian telescopes have concave secondary reflector. 
        As with the Cassegrain subreflector, the Gregorian reflector shape is determined 
        by the requirement that all parallel axial rays travel the same distance to reach the secondary focus at f2.  
        For a subreflector located above the prime focus, the required shape is an 
        ellipsoid whose major axis coincides with the major axis of the paraboloid.

    <p>Off axis telescope like the Green Bank Telescope. Projected onto a
         plane normal to the beam, it is a 100 m diameter circle. Because the projected 
         edge of the actual reflector is 4 m away from the axis of the 208 m paraboloid, the focal point does not block the aperture.  The GBT enjoys the same clear-aperture benefits of waveguide horns—a very clean beam and low spillover
         noise—but is much larger than any practical horn antenna. </p>

    <h3>Arecibo Telescope.</h3>
    <p>
        The arecibo telescope is completely circular and thus they can move the reflector around with 20 degrees
        of freedom. Thus the focus is a line. 
        A spherical reflector focuses a distant point source onto a line segment, so a line feed is needed to illuminate the entire aperture efficiently from the prime focus.  Slotted-waveguide line feeds are inherently narrow band, and ohmic losses increase the system temperature significantly at short wavelengths.

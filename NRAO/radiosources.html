    <h3>Superluminal velocities</h3>
    <p>
      Basically we can observe things that can appear to travel faster than the speed of light. For example, if you 
      had a powerful lazer pointer and you moved it across a surface very far away. The point could travel faster than the speed of light
      only because, the point of light does not actually represent a physical thing and thus, the appearance of it traveling faster than light 
      is just an illusion. Take the following example:   
    </p>

        Given this geometry setup we can calculate the time required for it to reac out eyes. So at the inital emission we get 

    </p>
    \[T_1 = {r \over c} \]
    <p>The delayed time would be the following</p>
    \[T_2 = {r - vt\cos\theta \over c}+ T1\]
    <p>We can find the APPEARANCE velocity with the simple formula </p>
    \[v_\bot = {\Delta d \over \Delta T}\]
    \[v_\bot = {\Delta d \over T_2 -T_1}\]
    \[T_2 -T_1 = {r - vt\cos\theta \over c}+ T1 - T_1\]
    \[T_2 -T_1 = {r - vt\cos\theta \over c}\]
    \[v_\bot = { vt\sin\theta \over {r - vt\cos\theta \over c}}\]
    \[v_\bot = { vt\sin\theta \over {r - vt\cos\theta \over c}}\]
    \[v_\bot = { vct\sin\theta \over r - vt\cos\theta }\]
    <p>We know that \(r = ct\)</p>
    \[v_\bot = { vct\sin\theta \over ct - vt\cos\theta }\]
    \[v_\bot = { v\sin\theta \over 1 - v\cos\theta/c }\]
    <p>Before we defined the velocity as a facto of the speed of light </p>
    \[\beta = v/c\]
    \[ v= \beta c\]
    \[v_\bot{\rm (apparent)} = { v t \sin \theta
        \over t (1 - v \cos \theta / c) }\]
    <p>With our previous equation we can replace all the velocities with \(\beta\)</p>
    \[{\beta_\bot{\rm (apparent)} = {\beta
        \sin \theta \over 1 - \beta
        \cos\theta}}\]
    <p>Now we want to find the derivative and find the MAXIMUM value of the function to show how light can appear to travel
        faster than the speed of light. 
    </p>
    \[{\partial \beta_\bot{\rm
        (apparent)} \over \partial \theta}
        = 0 = { (1 - \beta\cos\theta_{\rm m}) \beta \cos \theta_{\rm m} - 
        (\beta
        \sin\theta_{\rm m})
        ^2 \over (1 - \beta \cos \theta_{\rm m})^2 }\]
    <p>We then solve for zero, we should get </p>
    \[\cos \theta_{\rm m} = \beta\]
    <p>The problem is we need to find a value for \(\sin \theta_{\rm m}\) to find the maximum of the function 
        thus we use a little trick. We know that
    </p>
    \[\sin^2 \theta = 1- \cos^2\theta\]
    \[\sin \theta = \sqrt{1- \cos^2\theta}\]
    <p>In terms of cosine we can THEN replace </p>
    \[\sin \theta = \sqrt{1- \beta^2}\]
    <p>We know that this is in the form of the lortenz factor </p>
    \[\sin \theta = \gamma^{-1}\]
    <p>Plug back in.</p>
    \[{{\rm
        max}[\beta_\bot{\rm (apparent)}] = {\beta (1 - \beta^2)^{1/2} \over 1 -
        \beta^2} = \beta \gamma}\]
    <p>However if we were to consider the relativistic doppler effects we can doppler boost into the frame we
         know the following is true from standard relativistic doppler shift</p>
 \[\nu = {\nu' \over \gamma(1 - \beta \cos\theta)}\]
 <p>Lets set values for \(\delta \) as the following to find the DOPPLER FACTOR. How much it is doppler shifted by</p>
    \[\delta \equiv [\gamma(1 - \beta \cos
    \theta)]^{-1} = {\nu \over \nu'}\]
    <p>If everything is coming head on towards you you get the following as \(\theta = \pi/2\)</p>
    \[{ \delta = {\nu \over \nu'} =
    \gamma^{-1}}\]
    <p>For  directly receding \(\theta= \pi\) sources to</p>
    \[\delta \geq (2 \gamma)^{-1}\]
    <p>for directly approaching \(\theta=0\) sources.</p>
    \[\delta \leq 2 \gamma\]

    <h3>What is Compton Scattering? </h3>
    <p>Compton scattering is the idea that photons exist as particles and when striking free electrons, momentum must be 
        conserved even if they are "massless". This is because of relativistic effects caused by the massless photon 
        traveling at relativistic speeds to which in our frame the photon contains no mass. However, it can still collide 
        because in its frame it "has" mass. 
    </p>
    <p>Compton scattering is simply elastic collision of photons at relativistic speeds. Consider the drawing: </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="momentum.png">
    </div>
    <p>With some basic understanding of momentum conservation and geometry we get the following in the x direction: </p>
    \[p_i= p_f \cos\theta + p \cos \phi\]
    <p>For the y direction we get</p>
    \[p_f \sin\theta =  p\sin \phi\]
    <p>If we square both expressions and add them together we get the following </p>
    \[(p_i-p_f\cos\theta)^2 = p^2\cos^2\phi  \]
    \[ p_f^2\sin^2 \theta = p^2 \sin^2\phi\]
    <p>We add the square expressions together</p>
    \[(p_i-p_f\cos\theta)^2 + p_f^2\sin^2 \theta  = p^2\cos^2\phi  +p^2 \sin^2\phi\]
    <p>We can simplify identity </p>
    \[p_i^2+p_f^2 -2p_ip_f\cos \theta = p^2\]
    <p>Then we can apply energy conservation. We know the energy of the incoming photon and the out going photon and the rest 
        eneryg of the electron as \(m_ec^2\)
    </p>
    \[E_i +m_ec^2 = E_f +m_ec^2+E_k\]
    <p>We know that the kinentic energy of the photon electron is simply the energy change of the initial photon and the 
        rebounded photon since the PHOTON is the one giving energy. 
    </p>
    \[E_k = E_i-E_f\]
    <p>We can write the energy of the photon as the momentum </p>
    \[p={E \over c}\]
    \[E_k = c(p_i-p_f)\]
    \[E_i +m_ec^2 = E_f +m_ec^2+c(p_i-p_f)\]
    <p>Knowing this we can rewrite the relativistic equation in the following way. </p>
    \[E = m_ec^2 +E_k\]
    <p>Relativistic electron is all of it square is </p>
    \[E^2 = (m_ec^2)^2 +(c(p_i-0))^2\]
    \[E^2 = (m_ec^2)^2 +c^2 p^2\]
    \[(m_ec^2 +E_k)^2 =(m_ec^2)^2 +c^2 p^2\]
    <p>This simplifies to </p>
    \[{K^2 \over c^2} + 2E_Km_e = p^2\]
    <p>Now we can combine everything together. </p>
    \[p_i^2+p_f^2 -2p_ip_f\cos \theta ={K^2 \over c^2} + 2E_Km_e\]
    <p>Then we replace \(E_k =  c(p_i-p_f)\) and we simplify we get the following </p>
    \[m_ec(p_i-p_f) = (1-\cos \theta) p_ip_f\]
    <p>We can then rewrite it all into this form </p>
    \[{1\over p_f} - {1 \over p_i} = {1\over m_e c}(1-\cos\theta)\]
    <p>If we multiplied everything by Plancks constant we arrive at the compton scattering </p>
    \[\lambda_f - \lambda_i {h\over m_e c}(1-\cos\theta)\]
    <h3>What is INVERSE Compton scattering?</h3>
    <p>Inverse compton scattering is when an electron hits a ray and accelerates the ray of photons by some amount. The 
        electron gives off energy to the photon, instead of photon giving energy to the electron!
    </p>
    <p>Now with original compton scattering we can get the energy of the electron with this equation</p>
    \[E_1' = {E_0 \over 1+{E_0 \over m_ec^2}(1-\cos\phi)}\]
    <p>In order for there to be a substantial loss in energy as in describing the electron \(1+{E_0 \over m_ec^2}(1-\cos\phi)\)
        needs to be greater than 1 and thus \(E_0 >> m_ec^2\). This is for REGULAR compton scattering. 
    </p>
    <p>For inverse compton scattering needs to be relativistic frame since the electron is also moving, close to the speed of 
        light. Thus we need to preform a lorentz transform on the Energy as follows 
    </p>
    \[E_0' = \gamma E_0 (1-\frac{v}{c} \cos\theta_0)\]
    <p>Where \(1-\frac{v}{c} \cos\theta_0\) accounts for the doppler shifting of the energy.</p>
    <p>Now we are in the relativistic frame we can say the following </p>
    \[E_1' = {E_0' \over 1+{E_0' \over m_ec^2}(1-\cos\phi')}\]
    <p>Now we can get back the non-relativistic frame. </p>
    \[E_1 = \gamma E_1'(1+\frac{v}{c} \cos\theta_1)\]
    <p>Now we can plug in values in terms of the different frames! Problem is, the algebra is horrendous. Thus we 
        are gonna do a few limits so we have equations to solve for things when its useful.  </p>
        <p>The first limit is when \(E_0 << m_ec^2\) basically when it isnt very relativistic. Thus the bottom part is gonna disappear into just 1 and we get an 
        approximate solution. </p>
        \[E_1' = {E_0 \over 1+(0)(1-\cos\phi)}\]
        \[E_1' = {E_0}\]
        <p>Plug things back we get => </p>
        \[E_1 = \gamma^2 E_0 (1-\frac{v}{c} \cos\theta_0)(1+\frac{v}{c} \cos\theta_1)\]
        <p>The thing is the doppler shifts tend to equal to one, as you shift back and forth between red and blue shift of doppler effects </p>
        \[E_1 \approx \gamma^2 E_0 \]
        <p>Now if we were to consider if \(E_0 >> m_ec^2\) where it dominates the entire fraction then we would get an approximate </p>
            \[E_1 \approx m_ec^2\]
            \[E_1 ~ \gamma m_ec^2\]
        <p>Now what if the electron is spinning in a soup. We take the thompson scattering cross section, times the 
            speed of light times the number density of photons times the energy per photon. This should give us the 
            power!! 
        </p>
        \[P ~ \sigma_T \cdot c \cdot N \cdot \Delta E\]
        <p>Now if we want to find everything we integrate it over the number density of all photons times the number of photons 
            occupied per energy times the energy exchange at each energy times gamma square E0 because we are taking the energy exchnage at
            the LIMIT THAT WE CALCULATED FROM ABOVE ^^^
        </p>
        \[P ~ \sigma_T \cdot c \cdot \int N \cdot f(E) \gamma^2 E_0 dE\]
        <p>EVERYTHING is the energy density of the photons in that field!! </p>
        \[P ~ \sigma_T \cdot c \cdot \gamma^2 U_{ph}\]
        <p>We can make this more percices. By taking the change energy where we subtract off the inital energy</p>
        \[\gamma^-1 = {v^2c^2 \over 1- v^2/c^2}\]
        \[\gamma^-1 = \gamma^2 \beta^2\]
        <p>If we are even more careful we get a 4/3 factor https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/InverseCompton.html</p>
        \[P = {4\over 3} \gamma^2 \beta^2 \sigma_T \cdot c \gamma^2 U_{ph}\]

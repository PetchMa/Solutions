            Reflector Antennas
        </h1>
    </div>
   <p>For normal radio dipoles or short dipoles radio recivers or transmiters,
       they are often too weak, this is because the effective collecting areas
       are much smaller than a traditional dish. A reflector antenna works by 
       focusing a beam onto a feed meaning a larger collecting area.
   </p>
   <p>With all the types of radio telescopes, the beam of light must travel the same 
       length of path to a single point in order for it to be focused. If different light arrives
       at different times then the light is out of foucs. Same idea for radio waves! 
   </p>
   <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="reflector.png" width="600px">
    </div>
    <p>From the diagram above, the geometry proved that the following must be true
        if the path length must equal.
    </p>
    \[(f +
    h) = \sqrt{r^2 + (f - z)^2} +(h - z)\]
    <p>We need to extract the reflector height z as a function of radius r</p>
    \[\sqrt{r^2 + (f
        -z)^2} +h - z = f + h\]
    \[r^2 + f^2 + z^2 - 2fz = f^2 + z^2 + 2fz\]
    \[{z = {r^2 \over 4 f}}\]
    <p>For radio telescopes, when determining the focal length we are constrained to
        an \(f/D \approx 0.4\) because with higher ratios, the feeder becomes structurally 
        challenging to build and dangerous. However, with these low focal ranges, we 
        get a small field of view. To combat this we make the mirror flatter, or
        increase the distance the light travels by having subreflectors within the main 
        reflector. 
    </p>
    <h3>Far-field Distance </h3>
    <p>With astronomical objects, we assume the EM waves are planar and flat. However, how far do 
        they need to be for that approximation to be true?
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="farfield.png" width="600px">
    </div>
    <p>\(\Delta\) represents how far a planar wave is from the surface of the mirror
        when the first beam hits the curvature of the mirror. It is the maximum departure  
        from a plane wave occurs at the edge of the reflector. To find the distance we have 
    </p>
    \[R^2 = (R - \Delta)^2 + \biggl({D
        \over 2}\biggr)^2\]
        \[R = {\Delta \over 2} + {D^2 \over 8
            \Delta}\]
    <p>We can approximate it to the following as \(\Delta\) becomes really small 
        in comparison to \(D\). 
    </p>
    \[R \approx {D^2 \over 8 \Delta}\]
    <p>For radio astronomy we empircally define that \(\Delta < \lambda /16\) thus
    the maximum bound is the following </p>
    \[{R_{\rm ff} \approx {2D^2 \over 
        \lambda}}\]
    <h3>Patterns of Aperture Antennas</h3>
    <p>What if a beam came to the radio telescope at an off angle from main axis?
        What are the patterns that appear on the aperature? How can we calculate the beam pattern, or power gain as a function of direction, of an aperture antenna?
        To calculate such a scenario 
        consider the following example.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="planarwaves.png" width="600px">
    </div>
    <p>We first need to define that the current density will vary on position on the telescope 
        and the time. We know it travels at a fixed frequency. Thus we can say the following. that
         the electric field strenght varies across the aperature \(g(x)\) 
         The illumination induces currents in the reflector. The feed is illuminated by a sine wave. 
    </p>
    \[\nu =
    \omega /
    (2 \pi)\]
    \[J \propto g(x)
    \exp(-i\omega t)\]
    <p>We know the following: </p>
    \[v = \nu \lambda\]
    \[v = \omega/2 \pi \lambda\]
    \[v = {distance \over time}\]
    \[v = {r \over t}\]
    \[\omega  = {2\pi r \over t\lambda}\]
    \[J \propto g(x)
    \exp(-i {2\pi r \over \lambda})\]
    <p>The Huygen's principle states that the aperture can be 
        treated as a collection of small elements which act 
        individually as small antennas. The electric field 
        produced by the whole aperture at large distances is 
        just the vector sum of the elemental 
        electric fields from these small antennas. 
    Thus we can say the following: </p>
    \[df \propto g(x)
    {\exp(-i2\pi r / \lambda) \over r} dx\]
    <p>At large distances we see that </p>
    \[{1 \over r} \approx {1 \over R}\]
    <p>We can take out \(\frac{1}{r}\) is nearly constant across 
        the aperture and can be absorbed in the constant of proportionality.</p>
    <p>Since we are using small r we have the following equation from geometry</p>
    \[r \approx R
    + x \sin\theta\]
    \[df \propto g(x)
    {\exp(-i2\pi (R
        + x \sin\theta) / \lambda)} dx\]
    \[df \propto g(x)
    {\exp(-i2\pi R / \lambda) \exp(-i2\pi x \sin(\theta) / \lambda) } dx\]  
    <p>To clean up the equation let the following equal </p> 
    \[{l
        \equiv \sin\theta}\]
    \[{u \equiv {x \over
        \lambda}}\]   
        \[df \propto g(u)
    e^{-i 2 \pi l u} du\] 
    \[{f(l) =
        \int_{\rm aperture} g(u)
        e^{-i 2 \pi l u} du}\]
    <p>In words, this equation says:
        In the far field, the electric-field pattern 
        an aperture antenna is the Fourier transform of the electric field 
        illuminating the aperture!!!</p>
    <h3>Problem </h3>
    What is the electric-field pattern of a uniformly illuminated 
    one-dimensional aperture of width D at wavelength ? Uniform illumination means
     that the strength of the illumination is independent of position across the aperture.
     \[g(u) = {\rm ~constant}, \qquad {-D \over 2
        \lambda} < u < {+D \over 2 \lambda}\]
    <p>We will solve this problem in two steps, first finding 
        the far-field pattern of a unit aperture (D=) and then using the similarity theorem (below) for 
        Fourier transforms to scale the first result to our particular aperture.</p>
    <p>First we calculate the Fourier transform of the unit rectangle function</p>
        \[\Pi (u) \equiv 1\,, \qquad -1/2 < u < +1/2\]
        \[\Pi (u) \equiv 0\]
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="square.PNG" width="500px">
        </div>
    <p>We preform the fourier transform</p>
    \[F(l) =
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Pi(u) e^{-i 2 \pi l u} du\]
    \[F(l) =
    \int_{-1/2}^{+1/2} e^{-i 2 \pi l u} du\]
    \[F(l) = {e^{-i 2 \pi l u}
    \over -i 2 \pi l}\vert_{-1/2}^{+1/2} =
    {e^{-i \pi l} - e^{i \pi l} \over -i 2 \pi l}\]
    <p>We know the following by manipulating idenities </p>
    \[e^{i
        \pi l} - e^{-i \pi l} = 2 i \sin(\pi l)\]
        \[F(l) = {-2 i \sin(\pi l) \over -2 i \pi l}
        = {\sin(\pi l) \over (\pi l)}\]
        <div style="text-align: center">
            <img src="sinc.PNG" width="500px">
        </div>
        <p>With fouier transforms we have the similarity theorem stating the following </p>
        \[f(l) \to g(u)\]
        \[ g(au) \to { 1 \over
            \vert a \vert} f\biggl({l \over a}\biggr)\]
    <p>The similarity theorem states that making a function g wider 
        or narrower makes its Fourier transform f narrower and taller or wider and shorter, 
        respectively, always conserving the area under the transform. For our application, 
        it implies that the beamwidth of an aperture antenna is inversely proportional to the
         aperture size in wavelengths 
        and the voltage gain is directly proportional to the aperture size in wavelengths.</p>
